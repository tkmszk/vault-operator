## [3.0.2] -- 2026-06-23

### Obsidian Community Plugin Review Bot pass

Clears the Tier-3 popout-window-compat warnings the bot raised against
the EPIC-33 inline modules, removes five dead imports the bot's
linter flagged, declares the codemirror + dompurify packages the bot
expects to see in `package.json`, and converts the three `!important`
blocks the EPIC-33 styles added.

- `setTimeout` / `clearTimeout` -> `window.setTimeout` / `window.clearTimeout`
  in `SelectionWatcher.ts` and `InlineWebLookup.ts` for popout-window
  compatibility. The Node-shadowed timer type is replaced with plain
  `number` so the DOM `window.setTimeout` return type matches.
- `document.createElement` -> `activeDocument.createElement` in
  `CodeMirrorDiffAdapter.ts` so the inline diff hunk-actions widget
  renders into the popped-out window's document when the editor lives
  in a separate window.
- `@codemirror/state`, `@codemirror/view`, `dompurify` added to
  `devDependencies` so the bot's "should be listed in dependencies"
  warning clears. The packages still come from Obsidian at runtime
  (esbuild externalises them) -- the dev declaration is a metadata
  fix only.
- Removed five unused imports / type aliases the bot's lint flagged:
  `AgentTask` in `AgentSidebarView.ts`, `DynamicToolFactory` in
  `DynamicToolLoader.ts`, `ObsidianAgentPlugin` in `ExtractZipTool.ts`,
  `_edgesPass1` destructure in `LookupAction.ts`, `_UnusedTr` /
  `Transaction` type-only import in `CodeMirrorDiffAdapter.ts`.
- CSS Pattern M (class repetition) replaces `!important` across the
  fifteen lines the bot flagged: the inline panel anchor-toggle and
  close-button frameless rules, and the edit-review modal
  width/height/min-width/max-width rules. The repeated class lifts
  specificity to (0,2,0) or (0,4,0) where needed, so the rules still
  win against Obsidian's default modal sizing.

No user-visible behaviour change.

## [3.0.1] -- 2026-06-23

### Security

Six Dependabot alerts on transitive dependencies cleared by bumping
the `overrides` block in `package.json`. Neither package is reachable
from the desktop-only plugin runtime (Hono's AWS adapters and CORS
middleware never load in Obsidian, and DOMPurify is used through
Mermaid for diagram sanitisation only), but the project's policy is
to keep the dependency tree on patched releases regardless of reach.

- **hono 4.12.23 -> 4.12.27** clears five advisories:
  GHSA-j6c9-x7qj-28xf (CVE-2026-54287, AWS Lambda Set-Cookie merge),
  GHSA-wwfh-h76j-fc44 (CVE-2026-54286, `serve-static` Windows path
  traversal via `%5C`),
  GHSA-88fw-hqm2-52qc (CVE-2026-54290, CORS reflects any Origin with
  credentials -- the only High in the set),
  GHSA-wgpf-jwqj-8h8p (CVE-2026-54289, Lambda@Edge repeated header
  loss),
  GHSA-rv63-4mwf-qqc2 (CVE-2026-54288, body-limit bypass via
  understated `Content-Length`).
- **dompurify 3.4.10 -> 3.4.11** clears GHSA-cmwh-pvxp-8882
  (permanent `ALLOWED_ATTR` pollution via `setConfig()` -- incomplete
  fix of the 3.4.7 hook-pollution patch).

`overrides.hono` is now pinned to `>=4.12.25`, `overrides.dompurify`
to `>=3.4.11`. Full test suite 3480/3481 green plus 1 expected fail,
tsc clean, build clean.

## [3.0.0] -- 2026-06-23

### Inline-Editor AI surface (EPIC-33)

A new way to work with the agent: every selection in the editor is now a
direct entry point for the same agent loop the sidebar drives. The chat
moves into the note. Eleven curated actions plus a free-form chat panel
share one settings layer with the sidebar; nothing about the existing
sidebar workflow changes.

The inline surface is purely additive. There are no breaking changes for
existing users -- the sidebar, providers, vault tools, semantic index,
memory, MCP servers, skills, and history work exactly as before. The
major version reflects the change in interaction paradigm, not a SemVer
break.

### Added

- **Selection-triggered floating menu.** Highlighting text in the editor
  opens a compact menu over the selection with eleven actions: Lookup
  with vault-knowledge integration, Rewrite with inline diff and
  per-hunk Accept/Reject, Send-to-Main-Chat, Translate, Summarize,
  Find-Action-Items, Inline-Chat, Skills-from-the-floating-menu,
  optional Per-Action-Model-Pin. Default chord Mod+Shift+I, registered
  via the app scope so the user can also bind the underlying command
  through Settings -> Hotkeys.
- **Inline chat panel.** A full agent chat surface anchored to the
  selection. Drag the top grip to move the panel; drag the bottom-right
  corner to resize it. The panel runs the same `AgentTask` loop the
  sidebar uses -- skills, rules, memory, MCP servers, mode routing,
  steering messages, attachments, all of it.
- **Live checkpoint markers in the panel.** Every write tool the agent
  runs during an inline chat (`write_file`, `edit_file`, `append_to_file`)
  surfaces as a sidebar-parity checkpoint marker with four actions: show
  diff, undo this, undo from here, more menu. The Rewrite quick-action
  surfaces an explicit pre-apply review via the new `EditReviewModal`.
- **Inline conversations land in the main history.** The panel writes
  its turns to the same `ConversationStore` the sidebar uses, with a
  stable session task id so re-opening an inline conversation from the
  history surfaces the same checkpoint markers as a native sidebar
  conversation.
- **Vault-knowledge integration for Lookup.** Semantic search over the
  vault (10,783-vector default index) augments Lookup answers when at
  least one chunk clears the confidence threshold (`0.7` default, weak
  tier floor `0.6`). The augmentation is wrapped in `<vault_context>`
  tags inside the system prompt so a malicious note cannot escape the
  untrusted block.
- **Optional web fallback for Lookup.** When the vault has no strong
  coverage and a search provider (Brave or Tavily) is configured, one
  capped web search runs with a five-second timeout. Snippets are
  defanged before they reach the prompt and rendered as a deterministic
  appendix after the answer.
- **Skills appear in the floating menu.** Skills with the new
  `inline-action-eligible` capability flag show up next to the built-in
  actions. Output mode (`preview-block` / `inline-diff` / `side-panel`
  / `tooltip`) and `max_selection_chars` come from the skill manifest.

### Security

- Full per-item security audit
  ([AUDIT-EPIC-33-2026-06-23](_devprocess/analysis/AUDIT-EPIC-33-2026-06-23.md)).
  Three High and five Medium findings resolved before release: prompt
  injection hardening across all five actions (XML tagging of selection
  / vault / web contexts, defang of in-band closing tags), 5-second
  timeout plus title/url/snippet clamps on `InlineWebLookup`, allow-list
  guard for `PerActionPin`, hash-collision guard on `EmbeddingCache`,
  wikilink + Markdown-link sanitisation in `LookupAppendix`, enforced
  20-turn cap per inline conversation, capability re-check inside
  `InlineSkillAction`. Twelve regression tests pin the fixes in
  `src/core/inline/__tests__/audit-hardening.test.ts`.
- Vault-RAG weak-tier floor raised from `0.5` to `0.6` so the prompt
  augmentation never quotes a chunk that barely cleared random-baseline
  similarity.
- Embedding cache is cleared on plugin unload so per-session text never
  outlives the session in RAM.

### Deferred to backlog

- `FIX-33-AUDIT-03` Vault-folder filter for sensitive folders in the
  RAG pipeline.
- `FIX-33-AUDIT-04` `OperationLogger` live wiring for the inline action
  telemetry events (ADR-144).

---


## [2.8.1] -- 2026-05-14

### Security (AUDIT-024 fix-loop)

Bundle fix for the four AUDIT-024 findings (1 Medium plus 3 Lows, all
Defense-in-Depth). No user-visible behaviour change.

- **runtimeWorker SHA-cache (M-1).** The materialised worker file
  now stores a SHA-256 sidecar and verifies the hash before reuse.
  Replaces the byte-length-only check that allowed a forged file of
  identical size to survive.
- **runtimeWorker path-traversal hardening (L-1).** Hard whitelist
  for worker filenames (`sandbox-worker.js`, `mcp-server-worker.js`)
  plus explicit slash, backslash and double-dot rejection, plus a
  `startsWith` defense on the resolved path.
- **OptionalAssetManager path-traversal hardening (L-2).** New
  `assertSafeFilename` helper runs before every `filePath` and
  `shaSidecarPath` call. Rejects empty, slash, backslash, double-dot
  and leading dot.
- **OptionalAssetManager size cap (L-3).** `install()` and
  `installFromBuffer()` reject payloads over 50 MB before spending
  memory on a full SHA-256 digest. Catches both an oversized GitHub
  download and a wrong-file local pick.

Audit report: [`_devprocess/analysis/AUDIT-024-v2.8.0-2026-05-13.md`].

## [2.8.0] -- 2026-05-13

### Community-plugin-directory readiness

This release reshapes the plugin around Obsidian's community-plugin
review-bot rules so the plugin can be submitted to the directory. The
visible UX stays the same for existing users; the work is mostly under
the hood.

### Added

- **FirstRun setup wizard.** Seven-step modal that walks new users
  through provider setup (LLM, embedding model, role models, search
  provider, optional downloads). Auto-opens for the first three
  sessions, then stops nagging. Skipped steps surface as inline
  hint banners in the matching settings tabs.
- **Optional asset downloads.** Two large assets (ONNX reranker
  ~12 MB, self-development source bundle ~5 MB) no longer ship inside
  `main.js`. They live as separate GitHub-release assets, are
  downloaded once with explicit user consent, SHA256-verified, and
  stored under `<vault>/.vault-operator/assets/`. File-picker
  fallback for users without GitHub access.
- **Help tab in Settings** opens the docs site in the external
  default browser.
- **PluginPatchModal** replaces the agent's `manage_source` reload
  path. Compiled patches are offered as a `main.js` download with a
  step-by-step apply checklist instead of being written into the
  plugin folder automatically.
- **PRIVACY.md** at the repo root documents every system-identity
  read, background network call, and third-party service.

### Changed

- **main.js shrunk from 37 MB to 14 MB.** No `pluginDir` writes at
  runtime; workers, sql.js WASM, bundled skills and templates are
  inlined as TypeScript constants; ONNX and source bundle moved to
  the optional-download flow.
- **Vault folder defaults** for fresh installs are now
  `<vault>/.vault-operator/` (local data) and
  `<vault-parent>/vault-operator-shared/` (cross-vault data).
  Existing installs keep their legacy `.obsilo-vault/` and
  `obsilo-shared/` folders through a lazy fallback in
  `GlobalFileService`. No data migration needed.
- **Deep-link protocols** added `obsidian://vault-operator-chat` and
  `obsidian://vault-operator-settings`. Legacy `obsilo-chat` and
  `obsilo-settings` aliases keep existing frontmatter links working.
- **Backup format** new files use `vault-operator-backup`; legacy
  `obsilo-backup` files can still be imported.
- **VaultHealthRepairModal** stopped looking up a dead view-type
  string.
- **Memory + Soul chat** kicks off exactly once after wizard
  completion instead of on every plugin reload.

### Removed

- `AssetProvisioner` removed. Was the main "self-update via archive
  extraction" pattern the review bot rejected.
- `PluginReloader.deployAndReload`, `writeBundle`, `createBackup`,
  `rollback`, `hasBackup` removed. `PluginReloader.reload()` stays
  for post-manual-replace re-init.
- `vault-operator-assets.tar.gz` no longer produced by the release
  workflow.

### Internal

- Release workflow now generates GitHub artifact-build-provenance
  attestations for `main.js`, `styles.css`, the reranker WASM, and
  the source bundle.
- `esbuild.config.mjs` restructured: source-bundle generation moved
  out of `onEnd` so the bake-in SHA in `main.js` matches the
  generated `plugin-source.json` on every build.
- `package.json` version aligned with `manifest.json`.

---

## [2.7.4] -- 2026-05-13

### Added

- **EPIC-24 Wave 2+3: Agent-Loop Cost & Robustness.** Four new agent-loop
  features that reduce cost and improve subagent ergonomics, complementing
  Wave 1 (cache prefix, microcompaction, tool-output discipline) shipped in
  2.7.3.
  - **FEAT-24-09 (Active Skills, on-demand).** The skill directory now lives
    inside the cached prompt prefix and the model loads a single skill body
    on demand via the new `read_skill` tool. Replaces the per-message
    keyword classifier so cache stays warm across turns. (ADR-116.)
  - **FEAT-24-06 (MCP-Listing-Cap + on-demand detail).** MCP tool
    descriptions in the system prompt are capped at 200 characters; the new
    `read_mcp_tool({server, name})` tool fetches the full description and
    input-schema summary when the model needs it. Also defers `inspect_self`
    and `update_settings` to the deferred-tool set so they only land in the
    schema after `find_tool` activation. (ADR-118 supersedes ADR-117.)
  - **FEAT-24-04 (Subagent profile).** `new_task({profile: 'research'})`
    spawns a lean subagent with a read-only tool allowlist (10 schemas vs.
    34 in main) and a tight role definition. Parent context stays flat
    after the subtask returns. Per-call token budget (default 8000) bounds
    spawn messages. (ADR-113.)
  - **FEAT-24-07 (Helper-Model-Routing).** New top-level setting
    `helperModelKey` routes four internal LLM calls (context condensing,
    fast-path planning, plan_presentation, recipe promotion) to a cheaper
    helper model when set. Settable via the new "Helper model" dropdown in
    Settings -> Vault Operator -> Agent behaviour -> Loop. Fail-closed:
    invalid setting falls back to the main model. (ADR-115.)

- **IMP-24-06-02: `list_pinned_conversations` tool.** Lists chat
  conversations the user pinned to memory via the Star button or
  `mark_for_memory`. Complementary to `list_memory_source_notes` (which
  lists vault notes registered as memory-source). Reads
  `facts.source_session_id` from the FactStore.

### Changed

- **IMP-24-04-01: research subagent completion discipline.** The
  RESEARCH_PROFILE role definition now requires the subagent to put the
  concrete output the parent asked for into `attempt_completion.result`
  (with an explicit anti-pattern example), instead of a meta-acknowledgement
  like "5 relevant notes identified". Reduces parent followup work and
  cost when a subagent is spawned for structured research.

### Fixed

- **FIX-04-03-02 (P0, issue #34).** Claude Opus 4.7 and OpenAI GPT-5.x
  reject any `temperature` parameter with a 400 ("temperature is
  deprecated", "only default value 1 is supported"). The plugin sent
  `temperature` unconditionally from five providers (anthropic, openai,
  bedrock, kilo-gateway, chatgpt-oauth); only the OpenAI o-series was
  skipped. New shared `modelSupportsTemperature()` helper in
  `model-registry.ts` returns false for `claude-opus-4-7*` and `gpt-5*`
  (normalises OpenRouter / Bedrock aliases) and all five providers now
  omit the parameter when false. Live-reported by @edding333 on the
  public repo.
- **FIX-04-03-03 (P0, issue #33).** Custom OpenAI-compatible providers
  like `opencode go` hit CORS in the Obsidian renderer. The
  `createNodeFetch()` bypass that uses Node.js `https` to skip
  CORS-enforcement was hardcoded to `type === 'gemini'` only, and even
  if enabled it was hardcoded to HTTPS port 443. Makes `createNodeFetch`
  protocol-aware (http vs https module, port 80 vs 443) and activates
  the bypass for `custom`, `ollama`, and `lmstudio` as well as the
  existing `gemini`. Reported by @hfr38.
- **FIX-24-09-01 (P1).** `skill-directory` prompt section stayed hidden
  for users who started but never finished the onboarding wizard but used
  the plugin productively afterwards. New `isActiveOnboardingFlow()`
  helper distinguishes "wizard currently active" from "wizard abandoned
  but plugin is in use" by also checking `activeModels.length`.
- **FIX-24-07-01 (P1).** `update_settings` could not write five EPIC-24
  settings (`helperModelKey`, `subtaskTokenBudget`,
  `microcompactionEnabled`, `rollingSummaryThreshold`,
  `costWarnThresholdEur`) because `WRITABLE_PATHS` was not updated when
  the settings shipped. All five paths added to the allowlist and pinned
  by a regression test.
- **FIX-24-07-02 (P1).** `helperModelKey` had no settings UI; only
  settable via the `update_settings` tool or `data.json` edit. New
  "Helper model" dropdown at the bottom of the Loop settings tab.
- **FIX-24-06-01 (P1).** The deferred-tool filter only removed deferred
  tools from the prompt schema; the model could still hallucinate the
  call from training and the execution path ran the tool with hallucinated
  arguments, wasting cost on wrong-path retries. Adds an execution-side
  guard in `AgentTask.runTool` that returns a tool_error pointing the
  model at `find_tool` when a deferred tool is called without activation.
- **FIX-24-06-02 (P1).** `MemorySourceStore` was never initialised
  because the init at `main.ts:600` checked `memoryDB?.isOpen()` before
  `memoryDB` itself was opened ~500 lines later. All three memory-source
  tools (list/mark/unmark) returned "MemorySourceStore not available".
  Adds a second-pass init right after `memoryDB.open()`.
- **FIX-24-06-03 (P1).** `read_mcp_tool` was registered in `ToolRegistry`
  but missing from `TOOL_GROUP_MAP.mcp`, so the schema filter removed it
  from every mode. The model tried to route the call via `use_mcp_tool`
  to the MCP server (which rejected it as "unknown tool"). Same drift
  pattern as BUG-021 / FIX-19-28. Adds the tool to the `mcp` group plus
  a coverage test.

### Compliance

- 1490 tests passing (+23 from 2.7.3). lint clean for all touched files.
  tsc clean. Build + deploy green.

---

## [2.7.3] -- 2026-05-13

### Changed

- **Rebrand to Vault Operator.** Plugin id and display name changed from
  `obsilo` / "Obsilo" to `vault-operator` / "Vault Operator". Apache-2.0
  LICENSE is now canonical. First release under the new plugin id.
- **EPIC-24 Wave 1: Agent-Loop Cost (cache prefix + microcompaction).**
  The system prompt is split at an explicit cache breakpoint so stable
  sections stay cache-warm across turns. Microcompaction prunes consumed
  tool_result blocks from the live history, freeing tokens without losing
  task continuity. Bedrock provider added cache-point markers. Tool-output
  externalization stays out of the cached prefix.

### Fixed

- Versions.json backfill: 2.7.2 was missed at release time and is now
  included alongside 2.7.3.

---

## [2.7.2] -- 2026-05-12

### Compliance

- Lint cleanup and review-bot prep ahead of the rebrand release.

---

## [2.7.1] -- 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- **FIX-14-03-01 (P1).** Relay poll interval raised from 2 s to 10 s. Cloudflare
  Workers Free Plan caps requests at 100k/day per account; the 2 s polling
  alone produced 43.200 requests/day per open Obsidian instance, independent of
  actual MCP usage. With BRAT hot reloads and multi-device setups the cap was
  hit even on idle days, surfacing as HTTP 429 + worker code 1027 (quota
  exhausted). Poll interval and reconnect delays moved into named constants in
  `src/mcp/RelayClient.ts` so the cost story is explicit. (FEAT-14-03,
  EPIC-14, ADR-55.)
- **FIX-14-03-02 (P2).** Relay `pollLoop` bare `catch {}` hid HTTP status,
  body, and stack. Replaced with a `describeRequestError` helper that builds a
  one-line diagnostic and a `redactToken` helper that strips the relay token
  before logging. After 3 consecutive failures a single Notice surfaces the
  outage without devtools. AUDIT-005 H-2 / H-3 still hold: every logged string
  runs through token redaction. (FEAT-14-03, EPIC-14, ADR-55, AUDIT-005.)

### Compliance

- **Review-bot pass on PR #11394.** 29 findings flagged on the public mirror
  commit `c17f37d` cleared. Mix of TypeScript hygiene rules and the
  `obsidianmd/ui/sentence-case*` family.
  - Stringification (`@typescript-eslint/no-base-to-string`): type guards
    instead of `String(unknown)` in `AutoTriggerObserver.matchesValue`,
    `SemanticIndexService` tag lookup, and `validateNewTaskInput` (4 fields).
  - Unbound method: `DeepIngestPipeline` wraps `TensionDetector.markerWorthy`
    in an arrow function so `this` stays bound.
  - Floating promise: `updateMemory` legacy telemetry call prefixed with
    `void`.
  - Redundant union: `string | unknown` -> `unknown` in `executeVaultOp`
    (`string` is already a subtype).
  - `obsidianmd/no-static-styles-assignment` disable in `main.ts` line 927
    replaced by a new `.agent-u-cursor-pointer` utility CSS class.
  - Sentence case (29 strings): `Vault Operator` brand removed from settings, error
    and onboarding copy ("the agent" instead). ChatGPT account block reworded
    to avoid `ChatGPT` / `OS` / `Plus` / `Pro` tokens. Eleven BA-25 commands
    and notices in `main.ts` translated from German to English. `MOC` replaced
    with `map-of-content` / `hub` in vault settings.
- **Plugin store submission ready.** Local ESLint with bot-style rules
  reports 0 errors on the entire codebase.

---

## [2.7.0] -- 2026-05-04

### Added

- **Cross-Surface AI Workflow (EPIC-23, BA-26).** Externe Surfaces wie
  Claude Desktop, ChatGPT und Perplexity koennen Vault Operators Memory- und
  History-Layer ueber MCP ansprechen. Neue Remote-MCP-Tools:
  - `save_to_memory` -- Fact-Persistierung mit Source-Tagging
  - `save_conversation` -- Konversation als Living Document
  - `recall_memory` -- Cross-Source Memory-Retrieval
  - `search_history` -- Cross-Source History-Suche
  - V1 `update_memory` deprecated, Migration-Helper im Settings-Tab
- **Source-Interface-Tagging (ADR-108, FEAT-23-04).** Jede Conversation
  traegt eine Origin-Surface (claude / chatgpt / perplexity / obsilo /
  other / unknown). History-Sidebar hat Source-Tabs zum Filtern. Per
  Provider konfigurierbarer Sync-Mode (Auto / Manual) gegen
  Privacy-Trade-Off.
- **Living Documents + Cross-Interface-Threads (ADR-110, FIX-23-01-01..05).**
  Mehrere `save_conversation`-Calls werden in einen Thread mit ID
  `thread-YYYY-MM-DD-{6-hex}` gebuendelt. Living-Documents append-only.
- **Vault-zu-Memory-Bruecke (FEAT-03-25, ADR-109).** Vault-Notizen lassen
  sich als Memory-Source markieren. FrontmatterIndexer beobachtet
  Aenderungen und triggert SingleCallProcessor. Hooks
  `addNoteAsMemorySource` / `removeNoteAsMemorySource`.
- **Karpathy-Wiki-Pattern fuer Vault-Summary-Pflege (BA-25).**
  Vollstaendige Implementation in fuenf Phasen:
  - Phase 1 Foundation: knowledge.db Schema v9 -> v10 Bundle (4 neue
    Tabellen), Auto-Summary-Pipeline
  - Phase 2 Lint-Foundation: Tension-Detection (Hybrid)
  - Phase 3 Ingest-Foundation: Pre-Triage-Tool, Auto-Trigger-Detection
  - Phase 4 Power-User Backend: Frontmatter-Conflict-Detection
  - Phase 5 Erweiterte Schichten: Stufe-3 Job-Runner mit
    Token-Budget-Enforcement, Top-Hub-Block mit
    KV-Cache-Block-Lifecycle
- **Memory v2 Stabilisierungs-Pass (Track 3).** Drei IMPs:
  - IMP-03-17-01 recall_memory cosine NaN-Guard
  - IMP-03-18-01 AgingService daily-scheduler
  - IMP-03-18-02 DriftBus throttle-bypass
- **21 neue Architekturentscheidungen.** ADR-90 bis ADR-110, alle
  Accepted und in arc42 Section 9 verlinkt. Schwerpunkte:
  Cost-Aware Heuristics, KnowledgeDB v10, Source-Identitaet,
  Cluster-Halbwertszeit, Frontmatter-Conflicts, MOC-Marker, KV-Cache,
  Pre-Triage, Tension-Detection, Output-Modus, Web-Search, Stufe-3
  Runner, MCP-Memory-Versionierung, Source-Interface-Tagging,
  Vault-zu-Memory-Bruecke (supersedes ADR-87), Living-Documents.

### Changed

- **arc42 v5.1 (2026-05-04).** Section 1 Status um EPIC-23, BA-25,
  AUDIT-014/015/016 erweitert. Section 5.5 Schema-Version von v5 auf
  v10. Section 5.9.1 Memory v2 von "in Vorbereitung" auf "Cross-Surface
  MCP released". Section 8.14 MCP-Tools-Block aktualisiert. Section 9
  ADR-Tabelle um 21 neue Eintraege ergaenzt.
- **`/coding`, `/testing`, `/security-audit` Skills.** Pre-Commit
  Backlog-First Sync-Chain, Wayfinder-Maintenance, Plan-Coverage-Gate
  binding (siehe `.claude/skills/`).

### Fixed

- **FIX-22-07-01 (P0).** Sidebar view crash beim BRAT-Hot-Reload, weil
  `onOpen()` lief bevor `doLoad()` die Settings geladen hatte.
  `plugin.readyPromise` synchron in `onload()` erstellt, View `await`s
  vor jedem Settings-Zugriff.
- **FIX-04-09-01 (P1).** OpenAI-Provider-Streaming verschluckte
  Tool-Calls, wenn `finish_reason === "stop"` (statt `"tool_calls"`)
  nach gefuellten `delta.tool_calls` kam. Post-Loop-Flush fuer den
  Accumulator addiert. Gleicher Fix auf github-copilot, kilo-gateway,
  chatgpt-oauth uebertragen.
- **FIX-05-02-02 (P1).** SandboxBridge-Circuit-Breaker blieb nach 20
  Fehlschlaegen permanent offen und blockierte selbst triviale
  `evaluate_expression`-Aufrufe. `CIRCUIT_COOLDOWN_MS = 30_000` plus
  `lastErrorAt` Timestamp; Auto-Reset nach Cooldown-Ablauf.
- **FIX-15-00-01 (P1).** KnowledgeDB-Korruption durch nicht-atomare
  Writes plus Cloud-Sync. Atomic-Write (tmp -> rename), Multi-File-
  Coordination via Journal, integrity_check + Auto-Recovery beim Open,
  Lock-File gegen parallele Plugin-Instanzen, Daily-Snapshots mit
  7-Tage-Retention (PLAN-003).
- **FIX-18-03-02 (P1).** `read_file` konnte externalisierte Tool-Results
  unter `.obsidian-agent/tmp/task-*/` nicht oeffnen. Externalizer
  schreibt jetzt unter `{vault}/.obsidian-agent/tmp/...` (vault-
  resident, von vault.adapter aufloesbar, weiterhin
  Obsidian-Index-ignoriert).
- **FIX-18-04-01 (P1).** Streaming-Tool-Error in vier Providern
  (github-copilot, openai, kilo-gateway, chatgpt-oauth) emittierten
  einen `text`-Chunk statt `tool_error`. AgentTask-Mistake-Counter
  griff nicht, der Loop lief endlos. Alle vier auf `tool_error`-Chunk
  umgestellt. EditFileTool-Error-Message gibt Tool-Routing-Hint bei
  grossen `new_str`.
- **FIX-01-12-01 (P1).** Drag-and-drop aus dem Obsidian-File-Explorer
  oeffnete einen neuen Tab statt die Datei an den Chat zu attachen.
  `app.dragManager.draggable` plus `stopPropagation` im drop-Handler.
- **FIX-03-26-02.** Top-Hub-Block-Toggle (und andere Settings-Sub-Toggles)
  reagierten nach Privacy-Acknowledge nicht. `loadSettings()` nutzte
  shallow `Object.assign` statt deep-merge -- neue Sub-Keys wurden
  durch persistierte Eltern-Objekte ueberschrieben. `deepMergeSettings`
  Helper rekursiv fuer Sub-Objekte.
- **FIX-03-23-01.** Onboarding-Memory-Step (BA-25 SC-02) fehlte im
  OnboardingService. Hauptdeliverable nachgereicht.
- **FIX-23-04-01 (Pass 1-7).** Perplexity-MCP-Streamable-HTTP-Compliance:
  Accept-Header-Negotiation (JSON vs SSE), Mcp-Session-Id Echo,
  body-pre-parse plus default content-type, notification 202 mit
  leerem Body und ohne Content-Type, protocolVersion-Echo,
  Living-Document Append-Logik relax.
- **FIX-23-01-01..05.** Living Documents + Cross-Interface-Threads:
  Thread-Pill UI, sync_session source_interface tagging,
  Auto-Tracking-Doppel-Suppression, ensureSession lazy,
  save_conversation per-message-cap (AUDIT-015 H-1).
- **FIX-03-18-01 (P2).** SingleCallProcessor budget-exhausted Test-Setup
  benutzte UTC-Date-Key, TokenBudgetGuard intern Local-Date-Key.
  Around-Midnight-UTC mismatched -> snapshot fiel auf Zero-Bucket
  zurueck, blockReason() = null, Mock throw. Day-Key gepinnt via
  `today` seam.

### Security

- **AUDIT-014 (BA-25 Pre-Release).** Medium-Risk, alle 4 Findings
  resolved. URL-Sanitizer in IngestTriageLogStore, Rate-Limit fuer
  AutoTriggerObserver, Settings-UI Privacy-Hinweis fuer Top-Hub-Block,
  Stufe3PeriodicJob state-Persistierung in DB.
- **AUDIT-015 (EPIC-23 Pre-Release).** 1 H + 3 M Findings, alle resolved
  und 50 neue Eval-Tests:
  - H-1 save_conversation per-message + per-call cap
  - M-1 McpRateLimiter (sliding-window, 3 Klassen)
  - M-2 sanitizeVaultContentForLLM gegen Prompt-Injection
  - M-3 strictSourceIsolation Setting fuer recall_memory + search_history
- **AUDIT-016 (Full-Codebase, periodic).** 0 C / 1 H / 4 M / 5 L / 3 I,
  9/10 Findings resolved, 1 deferred (IMP-23-04-05 relay /poll
  Partitionierung):
  - H-1 sync_session Cap-Vererbung von save_conversation
  - M-1 write_vault content-cap (4 MB / 16 MB)
  - M-2 search_history LIKE-wildcard escape
  - M-3 get_context strictSourceIsolation gating
  - M-4 ConversationStore.generateId crypto.randomUUID
  - L-1 ActiveMcpSessions ohne djb2-Hash
  - L-2 cosine NaN-Guard (`Number.isFinite(sim)`)
  - L-3 OutputModeGenerator instanceof TFolder statt cast
  - L-5 validateVaultRelativePath Helper (3 Tools deduped)
