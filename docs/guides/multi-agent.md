# Multi-agent and tasks

For complex work, a single agent conversation can get unwieldy. Vault Operator handles this with sub-agents: child agents that take on specific parts of a larger task on their own. It also pulls actionable tasks out of conversations and turns them into trackable notes.

**You will need:** a working chat with at least one configured model. Sub-agents inherit the parent's model unless you give them their own agent profile with a different model assigned.

**Use this guide when:** a task is too large for one chat (researching three topics in parallel, processing a folder of files, comparing vault content against external research), or when you want extracted tasks to land as notes you can track.

**You will know it works when:** the agent spawns a sub-task with `new_task`, the activity log shows lines prefixed with `[subtask]`, the result flows back into the parent, and (if task extraction is on) actionable checkboxes from the conversation appear as task notes in the configured folder.

### When to delegate vs. stay in one chat

- **Stay in one chat** for sequential work in a single domain ("read note A, then edit note B").
- **Delegate** when steps are independent (three searches that do not depend on each other), when one step needs a different agent profile (a read-only analyst while the parent writes), or when context would balloon (large research with many tool results).
- **Avoid delegating** for tasks that finish in 2-3 tool calls. The cost of spawning a sub-agent outweighs the benefit.

## What are sub-agents?

A sub-agent is a separate agent instance spawned by the main agent. It gets its own conversation, its own agent profile, and its own tool access. The parent hands off a specific job, waits for the result, then carries on.

### When sub-agents help

- Research fan-out: search multiple topics in parallel instead of one after the other
- Divide and conquer: break a large task into independent pieces
- Profile isolation: run a read-only analysis under a restricted agent profile while the parent keeps full tool access
- Long tasks: keep the main conversation focused while a sub-agent handles a side errand

## How `new_task` works

The agent spawns sub-agents through the `new_task` tool. You don't call this tool directly. The agent decides when delegation makes sense.

### What the agent specifies

| Parameter | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `mode` | Which agent the child runs as. Defaults to the Default agent. |
| `message` | The full task description plus any context the child needs. The sub-agent cannot see the parent conversation, so the parent inlines everything relevant here. |
| `profile` (optional) | Picks a lean sub-agent profile, for example `research`, which runs read-only and skips the escalation justification. |

### Depth guard

Vault Operator caps sub-agent nesting at 2 levels (`maxSubtaskDepth` in `Settings > Vault Operator > Advanced`). A sub-agent at level 2 cannot spawn another sub-agent. When the cap is hit, `new_task` returns an error and the agent must execute the work itself.

```
Main agent (level 0)
  -> Sub-agent A (level 1)
      -> Sub-agent A1 (level 2, cap reached, cannot spawn further)
  -> Sub-agent B (level 1)
```

### Delegation patterns

The Default agent's system prompt names two delegation patterns and the agent picks between them:

- **Prompt chaining**: the parent runs steps sequentially, with each step depending on the previous result. Use when later work needs the earlier output.
- **Orchestrator-Worker**: the parent fans out independent sub-tasks in parallel, then merges results. Use for the research fan-out below.

### Parallel execution

Read-safe tools (searching, reading files, semantic search) run in parallel via `Promise.all`. A sub-agent researching three topics searches all three at once, not one after another.

:::tip You don't need to manage this
Sub-agent orchestration is automatic. Describe your goal and the agent decides whether to delegate. For example, *"Research these 5 companies and create a comparison table"* might spawn one sub-agent per company.

## Practical examples

### Research fan-out

Your prompt: *"Compare the note-taking approaches described in my notes about Zettelkasten, PARA, and Johnny Decimal"*

What happens:
1. The main agent spawns 3 sub-agents, one for each system
2. Each sub-agent searches and reads the relevant notes
3. Results return to the parent agent
4. The parent creates the comparison

### Divide and conquer

Your prompt: *"Reorganize my Projects/ folder. Group notes by status (active, completed, on hold) and create an index note"*

What happens:
1. A sub-agent analyzes all notes and classifies them by status
2. The parent agent creates the folder structure and moves files
3. A final sub-agent generates the index note with links

## Task extraction

Vault Operator watches for actionable items in agent responses. When the agent produces a list with unchecked checkboxes (`- [ ]`), the TaskExtractor picks them up automatically.

### How it works

1. The agent responds with tasks in its message (a project plan, action items)
2. Vault Operator detects the `- [ ]` items
3. A TaskSelectionModal pops up so you can pick which tasks to save
4. Selected tasks become individual notes in your vault

### Task notes

Each extracted task becomes a note with structured frontmatter:

```markdown
---
type: task
status: open
source: agent-conversation
created: 2026-03-31
---

# Review Q1 budget allocations

Compare actual spending against planned budget for each department.
Highlight any variance above 10%.
```

This plays nicely with your existing task management: Dataview queries, kanban boards, or any plugin that reads frontmatter.

:::info Not just agent tasks
Task extraction works on any checklist the agent produces: project plans, follow-ups from meeting notes, research next steps. If the agent writes `- [ ]` items, you can capture them.
:::

## Tips for multi-agent work

1. Be ambitious. Multi-step requests like "research, compare, and summarize" are exactly what sub-agents are good at.
2. Provide scope. Mention specific folders, tags, or file names so sub-agents know where to look.
3. Watch the activity log. Sub-agent tool calls appear there with a `[subtask]` prefix.
4. Use task extraction. When the agent gives you a plan, let it create task notes so nothing falls through the cracks.
5. Trust the depth limit. Two levels of sub-agents cover most real-world scenarios. If you need more, break the work into separate conversations.

:::warning Model quality matters
Each sub-agent runs its own conversation, so costs add up fast. Pick at least Claude Sonnet or an equivalent model; smaller models often misjudge when to delegate.
