# Vault operations

Vault Operator can read, write, search, and organize files across your entire vault.

**You will need:** Vault Operator installed and one model configured. Auto-approve is off by default, which is the safe choice while you learn how the agent edits files. For read-only review, create a Custom Agent with only the `read` and `vault` groups, or set Auto-approve to ask every time.

**Use this guide when:** you want to know which read, write, edit, search, and structure tools the agent has, when each fires, and how checkpoints protect you from a bad write.

**You will know it works when:** the agent can read a note you asked about, edit a single section without rewriting the whole file, move or rename a note with backlinks intact, and you can undo any write from the checkpoint history.

## How it works

The agent does not access your vault directly. It uses tools: small, single-purpose functions. When you ask it to find a note or create a file, it picks the right tools and calls them on your behalf.

Every tool call shows up in the [activity block](/guides/chat-interface#activity-blocks), and write operations need [approval](/guides/safety-control) unless you enable auto-approve.

## Reading your vault

These tools let the agent look at your files without changing anything. They are safe to leave on Auto-approve, since they never modify the vault.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **read_file** | Opens a note and reads its content |
| **list_files** | Lists files and folders in a given path |
| **search_files** | Finds notes by text content (keyword search) |
| **search_by_tag** | Finds all notes with a specific tag |
| **get_frontmatter** | Reads the YAML metadata at the top of a note |
| **get_linked_notes** | Follows wikilinks and backlinks from a note |
| **get_daily_note** | Opens today's daily note (or a specific date) |

### Examples

- *"What notes do I have in the Projects folder?"* (uses `list_files`)
- *"Find everything I wrote about client onboarding"* (uses `search_files`)
- *"Show me all notes tagged #review"* (uses `search_by_tag`)
- *"What links to my quarterly goals note?"* (uses `get_linked_notes`)
- *"Read today's daily note"* (uses `get_daily_note`)

:::tip Semantic search goes further
Keyword search matches exact words. To find notes by meaning (e.g., "notes about improving sleep" finding a note titled "Evening Routine"), see [Knowledge Discovery](/guides/knowledge-discovery).
:::

## Writing and editing

These tools modify your vault. Each call needs approval by default. You can change that under Settings > Vault Operator > Agents > Auto-approve.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **write_file** | Creates a new note or replaces an existing one |
| **edit_file** | Makes targeted changes to part of a note |
| **append_to_file** | Adds content to the end of an existing note |
| **update_frontmatter** | Changes YAML metadata fields |

### Examples

- *"Create a note summarizing our Q1 results"* (uses `write_file`)
- *"Replace the second paragraph in @project-brief with a shorter version"* (uses `edit_file`)
- *"Add today's action items to @task-list"* (uses `append_to_file`)
- *"Set the status field to 'complete' in @project-brief"* (uses `update_frontmatter`)

:::info Checkpoints protect your files
Before any write operation, Vault Operator saves a snapshot. If something goes wrong, click Undo in the [undo bar](/guides/chat-interface#the-undo-bar) to restore the original.
:::

## Organizing files and folders

These tools help you restructure your vault.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **create_folder** | Creates a new folder (including nested paths) |
| **move_file** | Moves a note to a different folder or renames it |
| **delete_file** | Sends a note to the Obsidian trash |
| **extract_zip** | Unpacks a `.zip` or `.skill` archive from the vault into a target folder (path-traversal + zip-bomb guarded) |

### Examples

- *"Create an Archive/2025 folder and move all notes tagged #archived there"* (uses `create_folder` + `move_file`)
- *"Rename @old-project-name to new-project-name"* (uses `move_file`)
- *"Delete all empty notes in the Inbox folder"* (uses `delete_file`)
- *"Unzip @ki-briefing-deutsch.zip into Inbox/"* (uses `extract_zip`)

:::warning Deletion respects Obsidian trash settings
Deleted files go to your configured Obsidian trash (system trash or the vault `.trash` folder). You can recover them from there.
:::

## Vault statistics

The agent can give you an overview of your vault using **get_vault_stats**:

- Total number of notes, folders, and attachments
- Vault size
- Tag distribution
- Recently modified files

**Example:** *"Give me a summary of my vault: how many notes, what are the most used tags?"*

## Canvas and visual maps

Vault Operator can create visual representations of your notes and their relationships.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **generate_canvas** | Creates an Obsidian Canvas (.canvas) with cards and connections |
| **create_excalidraw** | Creates an Excalidraw drawing (requires the Excalidraw plugin) |

**Example:** *"Create a canvas map showing all notes in the Projects folder and their connections"*

## Bases (structured data)

Bases let you work with your notes as structured data, similar to a database view.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **create_base** | Creates a new Base from notes matching certain criteria |
| **query_base** | Queries an existing Base with filters and sorting |
| **update_base** | Modifies entries in a Base |

**Example:** *"Create a Base of all notes tagged #book with columns for author, rating, and status from frontmatter"*

:::info Built on Obsidian Bases
Bases use Obsidian's built-in Bases feature. Vault Operator's minimum Obsidian version is 1.13.0, so Bases are always available.
:::

## Tips

1. Be specific about paths. "The Projects folder" is clearer than "my project notes."
2. Use @-mentions for specific files. The agent doesn't have to search for them then.
3. Let the agent chain tools. A request like "find all notes about X, summarize them, and create a new note with the summary" uses multiple tools automatically.
4. Check the activity block to see which files were read or changed.
5. For read-only exploration, create a Custom Agent with only the `read` and `vault` groups, or set Auto-approve to ask every time so no write goes through without your confirmation.
