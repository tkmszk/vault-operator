# Settings reference

All Vault Operator settings live under **Settings > Vault Operator**. The settings tab has six groups: Providers, Agents, Customize, Vault, Advanced, and Help. Each group has sub-tabs. This page walks every sub-tab in the order they appear.

UI paths in this page use the format `Settings > Vault Operator > {Group} > {Sub-tab}` in sentence case, matching the labels in `src/i18n/locales/en.ts`.

## Providers group

### Providers

`Settings > Vault Operator > Providers > Providers`

Configure AI providers. Each provider exposes its own model list and is mapped to three tiers (Budget, Main, Frontier) that the agent picks from based on the current task.

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Provider list | All configured providers with type, display name, sign-in status, and tier mapping | Empty | `src/types/settings.ts` (`providerConfigs[]`) |
| Active provider | The provider used for chat by default | First added | `settings.activeProviderId` |
| Add provider | Opens the provider detail modal | n/a | `ProviderDetailModal.ts` |
| Refresh (in modal) | Pulls the provider's model list and auto-classifies models into tiers | n/a | `ProviderDetailModal.ts:985-993` |
| Tier mapping | Manual override for Budget / Main / Frontier slots | Auto-classified | `model-registry.ts` |
| Test connection | Verifies the provider's credentials and endpoint with a minimal request | n/a | `testModelConnection.ts` |

The provider modal supports twelve provider types: Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, LM Studio, OpenRouter, Azure, Custom (OpenAI-compatible), GitHub Copilot, Kilo Gateway, AWS Bedrock, and ChatGPT (OAuth). Ollama and LM Studio prefill their Base URL with the local default port. ChatGPT (OAuth) bills against your existing Plus or Pro subscription instead of a per-token key.

:::tip Tiers and overrides
The Main tier drives chat by default. The agent escalates to Frontier on hard synthesis steps via the `consult_flagship` tool (budget: 3 calls per task, 3000 tokens per call). The chat-header model picker lets you pin a specific provider and model for a single task without changing the active provider.
:::

#### Per-model reasoning and thinking

Each model row in the provider modal exposes reasoning controls when the underlying model supports them. Pin a specific model in the chat-header picker to use these. Auto mode uses the model's default.

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Extended thinking | Enables Claude budget-token thinking on Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6 and older, Haiku, and 3.x models | Off | `BUILT_IN_MODELS` in `settings.ts` |
| Thinking budget (tokens) | Token budget reserved for the model's internal reasoning before visible output | 10000 (Sonnet/Opus), 5000 (Haiku) | `BUILT_IN_MODELS` |
| Reasoning effort | Effort level for adaptive Claude (Opus 4.7+, Fable, Mythos) and GPT-5 / o-series. Claude: Low, Medium, High, XHigh, Max. OpenAI: Minimal, Low, Medium, High | Model default | `model-registry.ts` |
| Max output tokens | Output budget. Auto clamps to the model ceiling and remaining context room | Auto | `resolveOutputBudget` in `model-registry.ts` |

:::info Caching reality
Anthropic uses explicit `cache_control` blocks. Bedrock Claude uses explicit `bedrock-cachepoint`. OpenAI gpt-4o, 4.1, o1, o3, and o4 use implicit prefix caching. Gemini has no prefix caching in v2.14 (TTL context caching is deferred). DeepSeek is not a registered provider type.
:::

### Models (legacy)

`Settings > Vault Operator > Providers > Models`

Legacy view kept for back-compat. New work happens in the Providers sub-tab via provider modals. Use this only if you need to inspect or remove a model entry that predates the provider-only refactor.

### Embeddings

`Settings > Vault Operator > Providers > Embeddings`

Configure the semantic index for meaning-based vault search. The Embeddings sub-tab has four sections: Embedding models, Semantic index, Index configuration, Graph expansion.

#### Embedding models

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Embedding model list | Configured embedding models with provider, model id, and API key | Empty | `settings.embeddingModels` |
| Add embedding model | Opens the embedding model modal | n/a | `EmbeddingsTab.ts` |

The first-run wizard suggests OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` or Google `text-embedding-004`. Other choices are fine if you bring your own provider.

#### Semantic index

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Enable semantic index | Master toggle. Build index is blocked until this is on | Off | `settings.semanticIndexEnabled` |
| Build index | Indexes the vault | n/a | `EmbeddingsTab.ts:230` |
| Force rebuild | Deletes the index and re-indexes from scratch. Cancel keeps progress | n/a | `EmbeddingsTab.ts:294` |
| Auto-index trigger | When to re-index automatically: never, on startup, on agent switch | `never` | `settings.semanticAutoIndex` (`settings.ts:1709`) |
| Auto-reindex on change | Re-index when files change | `false` | `settings.semanticAutoIndexOnChange` (`settings.ts:1720`) |

:::warning Build index is gated
The Build index button shows "Enable semantic index first." until you turn the master toggle on. Re-indexing on change is off by default. You stay in manual mode unless you opt in.
:::

#### Index configuration

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Chunk size | Chunk size for embedding. Small 800, Medium 1200, Standard 2000, Large 3000 | Standard (2000) | `EmbeddingsTab.ts:394-400`, `en.ts:117-120` |
| Reranking | Re-rank semantic search results for better relevance | Off | `settings.rerankerEnabled` |
| Confidence-weighted ranking | Factor edge confidence into graph expansion | On | `settings.confidenceWeightedRanking` |
| Knowledge freshness | Boost recently edited notes in search results | On | `settings.knowledgeFreshness` |

:::info Reranker model
The reranker uses `Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` and is delivered as an optional asset. If the asset is not installed, the agent falls back silently to the vector score. Install under `Settings > Vault Operator > Advanced > Optional assets`.
:::

#### Graph expansion

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Implicit connections | Discover hidden relationships between notes | Off | `settings.implicitConnectionsEnabled` |
| Graph enrichment | Add semantic similarity edges to the Obsidian graph | Off | `settings.graphEnrichmentEnabled` |
| Community detection | Run Louvain clustering on the knowledge graph at startup | On | `settings.communityDetectionEnabled` |

#### Knowledge properties

Vault conventions used by the knowledge ingest workflow and vault health check. Set these once to match your vault's schema.

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Category property | Frontmatter key that holds the note's type or category | `Kategorie` | `settings.knowledgeIngestProperties.categoryProperty` (`settings.ts:1723-1730`) |
| Summary property | Frontmatter key for the short note summary | `Zusammenfassung` | `settings.knowledgeIngestProperties.summaryProperty` |
| Source naming convention | Filename pattern for source notes created by ingest | `Autor-Jahr_Titel` | `settings.knowledgeIngestProperties.sourceNamingConvention` |
| MOC properties | Extra frontmatter keys that participate in Maps of Content | Empty | `settings.knowledgeIngestProperties.mocProperties` |

:::info Built-in defaults are German
The built-in templates ship with German defaults (Themen, Konzepte, Personen, Notizen, Meeting-Notes, Quellen). Adapt them in the same panel to match your vault's language and naming.
:::

### Web search

`Settings > Vault Operator > Providers > Web search`

Enable tools for accessing the internet.

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|

| Search provider | Which search API to use | Brave | `settings.webSearchProvider` |
| API key | Key for the selected search provider | None | `settings.webSearchApiKey` |

## Agents group

### Agents

`Settings > Vault Operator > Agents > Agents`

Configure agents. One built-in agent ships: **Default agent**. You can add custom agents with their own system prompt, tool sets, and per-agent model overrides.

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Default agent | The single built-in agent. All built-in tool groups are available | Built-in | `builtinModes.ts:58` |
| Custom agents | User-defined agents with custom tool sets and system prompts | Empty | `settings.customModes` |
| Per-agent model | Override which model an agent uses | Active provider's Main tier | `settings.modeModelKeys` |
| Per-agent tool overrides | Restrict tool groups for an agent (`modeToolOverrides`) | None | `settings.modeToolOverrides` |
| Per-agent skills | Attach specific skills to an agent | None | `settings.modeSkillKeys` |

:::info There is only one built-in agent
The earlier Ask + Agent split was removed in v2.11. For read-only behaviour, either restrict a custom agent's tool groups to `read` and `vault`, or set Auto-approve to "ask every time" for the write groups. The mid-conversation mode switcher was removed from the chat header in v2.11.
:::

### Auto-approve

`Settings > Vault Operator > Agents > Auto-approve`

Control what the agent can do without asking. See the [safety and control guide](/guides/safety-control) for details.

The seven approval categories map to the seven `ToolGroup` values in `TOOL_GROUP_MAP` (`builtinModes.ts`).

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Read | Auto-approve file reads, searches, listings, checkpoint inspectors | Off | `read` group: `read_file`, `read_document`, `list_files`, `search_files`, `list_checkpoints`, `read_checkpoint`, `diff_checkpoint` |
| Vault | Auto-approve vault intelligence (semantic search, frontmatter, daily note, memory recall) | Off | `vault` group: `semantic_search`, `query_base`, `get_frontmatter`, `search_by_tag`, `vault_health_check`, `recall_memory`, `mark_for_memory`, `search_history`, etc. |
| Edit | Auto-approve writes (file create, edit, append, move, delete, frontmatter update, ingest, checkpoint restore) | Off | `edit` group: `write_file`, `edit_file`, `append_to_file`, `create_folder`, `delete_file`, `move_file`, `update_frontmatter`, `generate_canvas`, `create_excalidraw`, `create_base`, `create_pptx`, `create_docx`, `create_xlsx`, `ingest_document`, `ingest_deep`, `ingest_triage`, `restore_checkpoint` |
| Web | Auto-approve `web_fetch`, `web_search`, `anti_echo_search` | Off | `web` group |
| Agent | Auto-approve agent control (followup questions, completion, todo updates, sub-tasks, agent switches, settings updates, skill invocation) | Off | `agent` group |
| MCP | Auto-approve calls to external MCP servers (`use_mcp_tool`, `read_mcp_tool`) | Off | `mcp` group |
| Skill | Auto-approve plugin command execution, recipes, plugin API calls, sandbox scripts | Off | `skill` group: `execute_command`, `execute_recipe`, `call_plugin_api`, `resolve_capability_gap`, `enable_plugin`, `probe_plugin`, `run_skill_script` |

:::warning Permissive combination warning
Turning on **Web** together with **Edit** (or **Vault** writes) triggers a security warning. That combination lets the agent fetch internet content and write it into your vault without asking.
:::

### Loop

`Settings > Vault Operator > Agents > Loop`

Control how the agent loop runs.

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|

| Max iterations | Maximum tool calls per conversation turn | 25 | `settings.maxIterations` |
| Context condensing | Summarize older messages when context gets long | On | `settings.condensingEnabled` |
| Condensing threshold | Percentage of context window before condensing triggers | 70 | `settings.condensingThreshold` |
| Microcompaction | Compact older tool results in place when their token cost exceeds a threshold | On | `settings.microcompactionEnabled` |
| Rolling-summary threshold | Token threshold above which microcompaction triggers | 12000 | `settings.microcompactionThreshold` |
| Power steering | Re-inject key instructions every N messages | 4 | `settings.powerSteeringFrequency` |
| Subtask depth | Maximum nesting depth for sub-agents | 2 | `settings.subtaskMaxDepth` (`settings.ts:1696`) |
| Subtask token budget | Token budget per `new_task` spawn message | 8000 | `settings.subtaskTokenBudget` |
| Cost-warn threshold | EUR cost threshold per task that triggers a warning | 0.50 | `settings.costWarnThreshold` |
| Default main-tier model | Which tier the chat loop uses by default | `mid` (Main) | `settings.defaultMainTier` |
| Task routing (Helper model) | Model used for context condensing, fast-path planning, `plan_presentation`, and recipe promotion | Falls back to active provider's Budget tier | `settings.helperModelKey` |

### Memory

`Settings > Vault Operator > Agents > Memory`

Configure how the agent remembers across conversations.

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Chat history | Save conversation history for future reference | On | `settings.chatHistoryEnabled` |
| Chat history folder | Where to store conversation files in the vault | `Vault Operator/Chats` | `settings.chatHistoryFolder` |
| Memory extraction | Automatically extract key facts from conversations | On | `settings.memoryExtractionEnabled` |
| Memory threshold | Minimum relevance score for a memory to be saved | 0.7 | `settings.memoryThreshold` |

:::info Memory model picker removed in FEAT-24-08
The separate "Memory model" dropdown is gone. The Task routing helper model runs memory extraction.
:::

## Customize group

### Rules

`Settings > Vault Operator > Customize > Rules`

Persistent instructions that guide the agent in every conversation.

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Rule list | All active rules injected into the system prompt | Empty | `settings.rules` |
| Add rule | Create a new rule (plain text or Markdown) | n/a | `RulesTab.ts` |
| Import | Import rules from a file | n/a | `RulesTab.ts` |

### Workflows

| Add workflow | Create a new workflow | n/a | `WorkflowsTab.ts` |

### Skills

`Settings > Vault Operator > Customize > Skills`

Persistent instruction sets matched by keywords. Like mini-manuals the agent follows.

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Skill list | All skills with name, trigger pattern, and body | Built-in bundled skills | `settings.skills` and `bundled-skills/` |
| Add skill | Create a new skill | n/a | `SkillsTab.ts` |

### Prompts

`Settings > Vault Operator > Customize > Prompts`

Reusable message templates with optional variables.

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Prompt list | All prompts | Empty | `settings.customPrompts` |
| Add prompt | Create a new prompt | n/a | `PromptsTab.ts` |

### Connectors

`Settings > Vault Operator > Customize > Connectors`

Connect external tool servers and expose Vault Operator as a server. The Connectors sub-tab has three sections: Local connector, Remote access, External tool servers.

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Local connector | Vault Operator as MCP server for desktop clients (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Perplexity) | Off | `settings.mcpServerEnabled` |
| Remote access | Cloudflare-tunnelled long-polling endpoint with token-in-URL auth | Off | `settings.remoteTransportEnabled` |
| External tool server list | MCP servers the agent can call tools on | Empty | `settings.mcpServers` |
| Add server | Configure a new MCP server connection. Transport types: SSE, streamable-http | n/a | `ManageMcpServerTool.ts:7,51`, `McpTab.ts:372` |
| Test server | Verify connectivity to a configured server | n/a | `McpTab.ts` |

:::info Transport limitation
Vault Operator runs inside Electron (Obsidian's runtime), so only SSE and streamable-http transports are supported. Stdio-based MCP servers do not work. To bridge a stdio-only server (for example Playwright MCP), run it locally with an HTTP wrapper such as `npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 3001`.
:::

## Vault group

### Vault

`Settings > Vault Operator > Vault > Vault`

Vault-level settings, including the agent folder, default output folder, and checkpoint behaviour.

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Agent folder | Vault-relative folder where Vault Operator keeps plugin skills, vault-dna snapshot, externalised tmp results, cache, and the local knowledge database | `.vault-operator` | `DEFAULT_AGENT_FOLDER` (`agentFolder.ts:38`) |
| Pick folder | Fuzzy-picker to choose an existing folder. Type a new path to create on next use | n/a | `VaultTab.ts` |

:::info Agent folder layout
The agent folder contains `data/` (skills, logs, telemetry, knowledge.db), `cache/` (backups, checkpoints, externalised tmp), and `assets/` (optional assets like the reranker model). Existing files are not auto-migrated when you change the path. The legacy name `.obsidian-agent` is still accepted for back-compat (upgraded in v2.13).
:::

### Backup

`Settings > Vault Operator > Vault > Backup`

Export and import your Vault Operator configuration. Useful when moving to a new device, sharing settings with a team, or restoring after a bad change.

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Export categories | Checkboxes for each settings category (providers, rules, skills, workflows, prompts, agents, soul, memory) | All on | `BackupTab.ts` |
| Export | Bundle the selected categories into a JSON file | n/a | `BackupTab.ts` |
| Select file (Import) | Pick a previously exported JSON file | n/a | `BackupTab.ts` |

:::

### Debug

`Settings > Vault Operator > Advanced > Debug`

Internal diagnostics.

| Setting | What it does | Default | Source |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Debug mode | Enable verbose logging to the developer console | Off | `settings.debugMode` |

Downloaded from the plugin's GitHub release, verified by SHA256 | Not installed | `OptionalAssetManager` |
| Office assets | Bundled fonts and theme assets used by `create_pptx`, `create_docx`, `create_xlsx` | Not installed | `OptionalAssetManager` |

### Language

`Settings > Vault Operator > Advanced > Language`

Set the agent's response language. The setting follows Obsidian's language by default. UI strings (settings labels, modals, errors) follow the Obsidian language separately.

## Help group

`Settings > Vault Operator > Help`

The Help group is not a content tab. It opens the public documentation in a new window. Use the in-app `Restart setup` button under Interface to re-run the first-run wizard.
