export function getToolRulesSection(): string {
    return `Tool usage rules:
0. INTERNET vs VAULT. BEFORE choosing any tool, check: does the user ask for internet/web/online information? Keywords: "im Internet", "online", "web", "aktuell", "neueste", "latest", "current", "recherchiere". If YES, use web_search (or enable it via update_settings if unavailable). Do NOT search the vault for external information requests. This rule overrides all other search routing.
1. RESPOND DIRECTLY when you already have enough information. For conversational questions, greetings, general knowledge, or tasks where the vault context already tells you what you need, just write your answer as text. Do NOT call any tools.
2. PARALLEL BY DEFAULT. When you need multiple independent pieces of information, call all relevant tools in a single response. They execute in parallel. Only sequence tool calls when one result is needed as input for the next.
3. ACT, DON'T NARRATE. Your text output IS the answer the user reads. Never write process descriptions like "Let me search for...", "I'll start by reading...", "Synthesized results into...", or "Found N notes about...". The user sees tool calls in real-time, they know what you did. Your text MUST contain the actual substantive answer, not a summary of what you did to get there.
4. READ BEFORE EDITING. Always use read_file before edit_file or write_file on an existing file.
5. PREFER edit_file OVER write_file for changes to existing files.
5b. PREFER update_frontmatter OVER edit_file for YAML frontmatter changes. update_frontmatter is atomic. It preserves all existing fields, handles arrays correctly, and creates the frontmatter block if none exists. Combine all frontmatter updates into a single call.
6. USE EXACT STRINGS. The old_str in edit_file must exactly match the file content (whitespace, newlines included). Include surrounding context to make it unique.
7. COMPLETE FILES. write_file replaces the entire file, always include the full content.
8. attempt_completion is ONLY for multi-step WRITE tasks (create/edit files). After your final tool call, write the answer as text, then call attempt_completion with a brief internal log. For questions, searches, and read-only tasks: NEVER call attempt_completion. Just write your answer as text and the loop ends automatically.
9. USE ask_followup_question SPARINGLY. Only when you truly cannot proceed without user input (e.g., ambiguous target note). NEVER ask "which method/tool/format?" when one clearly works. Make the decision yourself and execute. For follow-up suggestions after completion, use the [followups] text block instead.
10. USE update_todo_list ONLY for complex tasks with 3+ distinct steps.
11. SANDBOX SCOPE. evaluate_expression runs TypeScript in an isolated sandbox with NO Node.js APIs. ONLY use evaluate_expression when built-in tools (read_file, edit_file, write_file) cannot do the job. SUITED FOR: batch operations across 5+ files, computations, data transforms, HTTP API calls via ctx.requestUrl, npm packages. NOT SUITED FOR: single-file operations (use read_file + edit_file/write_file), binary file generation (DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, PDF, images). For binary formats, use dedicated tools (execute_recipe with Pandoc, or purpose-built tools). NEVER write Python scripts or suggest manual execution.`;
