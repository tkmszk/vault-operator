/**
 * Security Boundary Section
 *
 * Prompt injection guard. Instructs the model to treat every byte that
 * arrived through a tool result as untrusted user data, never as a new
 * instruction from the user or system.
 *
 * AUDIT-034 L-16: Section enumerates every boundary wrapper the agent loop
 * actually emits and lists the most common jailbreak sentinels so the model
 * does not honour them when they appear inside any of those wrappers. Section
 * stays above the cache breakpoint so the wording is part of the cached
 * prefix and costs no extra tokens per turn.
