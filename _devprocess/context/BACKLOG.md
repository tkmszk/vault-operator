## Graph-Health (letzter Check: 2026-05-12, Modus: A -- nach EPIC-24-Stubs + Checker-Fix)

**Kein einziges Finding durch EPIC-24 verursacht.** Verlauf: 101 (erster Run nach ARCH-Refinement) -> 88 (nach Stubs) -> **70** (nach Checker-Regex-Fix).

| Invariante | Status | Count | Anmerkung |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dead links / Broken Refs / ADR abstraction | ok | 0 | |
| orphan-backlog-row | ok | 0 | gefixt: 13 EPIC-24-Detail-File-Stubs angelegt (FEAT-24-01..09, FIX-24-01-01/03-01/03-02, IMP-24-05-01); 18 ADR-Rows mit 3-stelliger ID waren ein Checker-Bug (`ADR-\d{2}`-Regex) -- behoben in `$DIA_PLUGIN_ROOT/tools/consistency-check.py` + `.git/hooks-data/consistency-check.py` (2-3-stellige IDs); **muss upstream zum DIA-Plugin** (sonst verloren bei Plugin-Update) |
| duplicate-backlog-id | fail | 3 | **vorbestehend** -- FEAT-04-01/02/04 doppelt im EPIC-04-Backlog-Abschnitt (Office-Features create_docx/create_xlsx + "Agent Prompt & Skill Update" kollidieren mit MCP/Web/i18n; Altlast aus der EPIC-NNN->EPIC-NN-Migration). Fix = Renumbering released Features (FEAT-04-00/01/02 Office -> FEAT-10-XX, ggf. FEAT-04-04) -- braucht das DIA `apply-renumber`-Tooling + eigenen PR (kaskadiert: Detail-Files, FIX/IMP-IDs, GH-Issue-Links, ADR-104-Ref). NICHT ad-hoc fixen. |
| status-drift detail-vs-backlog | fail | 67 | **vorbestehend** -- historische EPIC-*-Files (EPIC-04..22) haben in ihren `## Features`-Tabellen Status-Spalten ("Geplant"/"Not Started"/"Implementiert vX"/"Ersetzt durch X"/...), die nicht zum BACKLOG-Status passen. Korrekter Fix per N-15: Status-Spalte aus den historischen EPIC-Tabellen entfernen (neuere EPICs haben sie nicht) bzw. an den BACKLOG angleichen -- mechanischer Pass ueber ~14 Files. Nicht durch EPIC-24 verursacht. |

- **DEBT-CC-2026-05-12** (Source: CONSISTENCY-CHECK, P3): Backlog-Graph-Hygiene-Pass, getrennt von EPIC-24 -- (a) 3x duplicate-backlog-id FEAT-04-01/02/04: Renumbering via `/dia-migration` / `apply-renumber`, eigener PR; (b) 67x status-drift detail-vs-backlog: Status-Spalten aus den historischen EPIC-*-`## Features`-Tabellen entfernen oder synchronisieren; (c) Checker-Regex-Fix (2-3-stellige IDs) lokal bereits angewandt -> upstream zum DIA-Plugin melden. Run-Datei: `.git/consistency-check.last-run.json`.
- **DEBT-SCA-2026-05-12** (Typ: Security, Source: SEC, P2): `npm audit` meldet 1 Moderate fuer `mermaid` (transitiv): GHSA-6m6c-36f7-fhxh (Gantt Infinite-Loop-DoS) + drei classDef/Config CSS-/HTML-Injection-Advisories. Vorbestehend (nach AUDIT-017 publiziert), NICHT durch EPIC-24 verursacht. Fix: `npm audit fix` bzw. Overrides-Bump im naechsten Dependency-Housekeeping-Pass. Reale Exponierung niedrig (lokales Plugin, Nutzer rendert eigene Diagramme). Evidence: `node_modules/mermaid`. Ref: AUDIT-018 SCA-M-1.

### EPIC-24: Agent-Loop Effizienz

Source: `_devprocess/requirements/epics/EPIC-24-agent-loop-effizienz.md`
Issue: https://github.com/pssah4/vault-operator-dev/issues/318
Phase: Architecture | Status: Active
Verwandt: RESEARCH-36 (Diagnose + 3-Wege-Vergleich Claude Code / EnBW Cowork), Nachfolger von EPIC-18 (Token-Kostenreduktion). UEBERLAPPUNG: Bedrock-cachePoint + OpenAI-cached_tokens decken bereits ADR-111 + IMP-18-01-02 (Active) ab -- NICHT hier duplizieren, IMP-18-01-02 aktivieren/zu Ende bringen. Caching-Praefix-Stabilisierung ist ein Amendment zu ADR-62. Externalizer-fuer-PDF-Attachments ist bereits FIX-18-02-01 (Open) -- FIX-24-03-01 ist die allgemeinere Variante (alle Tool-Results im Hauptloop + Re-Read-Cap).

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FEAT-24-01 | Feature | Cache-Praefix-Stabilisierung (Anthropic): System-Prompt-Block-Array, DateTime tagesgranular, Memory/Active-Skills aus gecachtem Bereich, rollende History-Breakpoints | Done | Building | EPIC-24, ADR-62, ADR-111, PLAN-18 | RESEARCH-36 |  |  | 2026-05-12 | P0 Welle 1; systemPrompt.CACHE_BREAKPOINT_MARKER + splitSystemPromptAtCacheBreakpoint; anthropic.ts: 2-Block-System-Param + cache_control auf letztem tools-Eintrag + 2 rollende History-Marker; dateTime tagesgranular (includeCurrentTimeInContext default false, steuert nur noch Time-of-Day). Bedrock-cachePoint + cached_tokens -> IMP-18-01-02 (Task 5). +5 Tests. |
| FEAT-24-02 | Feature | History-Komprimierung: Microcompaction der Tool-Results an Turn-Grenzen | Done | Building | EPIC-24, ADR-12, PLAN-18 | RESEARCH-36 |  |  | 2026-05-12 | P0 Welle 1; src/core/context/MicroCompactor.ts + AgentTask.microcompact()/maybeRollingSummary(); settings microcompactionEnabled/rollingSummaryThreshold; ADR-12-Amendment. 6 neue Tests. |
| FEAT-24-03 | Feature | Tool-Output- & Kontext-Disziplin: ADR-63-Externalizer im allgemeinen Hauptloop, Re-Read-Cap externalisierter tmp-Dateien, grosse Paste-/@-Mention-User-Messages kappen | Done | Building | EPIC-24, ADR-63, PLAN-18 | RESEARCH-36 |  |  | 2026-05-12 | P0 Welle 1; ResultExternalizer Re-Read-Cap + reichere Refs, ToolExecutionPipeline HARD_OUTPUT_CAP (60k), AttachmentHandler TOTAL_ATTACHMENT_CHAR_BUDGET (64k), toolDecisionGuidelines-Leitplanke. ADR-63-Amendment; verallgemeinert FIX-18-02-01. +6 Tests. |
| FEAT-24-04 | Feature | Subagent-Delegation fuer context-heavy Teilaufgaben (mit Per-Call-Token-Budget + Steering) | Planned | Planned | EPIC-24 | RESEARCH-36 |  |  | 2026-05-12 | P1 Welle 2; model-getrieben (new_task prominent + Profile + Prompt-Leitplanke), kein harter Router; ADR neu |
| FEAT-24-05 | Feature | Sichtbarkeit: Sidebar-Kosten-/Token-/Cache-Hit-Anzeige | Planned | Planned | EPIC-24 | RESEARCH-36 |  |  | 2026-05-12 | P1 Welle 2; Cowork extractCacheStats als Vorlage; haengt von IMP-18-01-02 (cached_tokens-Wiring) ab |
| FEAT-24-06 | Feature | Lazy-Loading der Tool-Schemas: Built-in (FEATURE-1600 erweitern) + MCP-Tools deferred (per-Server-Katalog im stabilen Prompt statt voller Schemas, Schema on-demand via find_tool) | Planned | Planned | EPIC-24, ADR-117, FEATURE-1600 | RESEARCH-36 |  |  | 2026-05-12 | P1 Welle 2; ADR-117; MCP-Anteil ist der eigentliche Hebel (volle MCP-Schemas heute bei jedem Call, kein Deferral, instabil bei Server-Aenderungen); hochgestuft 2026-05-12. Built-in-Spike: ~10-20k Tokens, FEATURE-1600 deckt die schweren schon. Vor /coding: tools-Feld-Token-Log in logInputBreakdown |
| FEAT-24-07 | Feature | Internes Hilfs-Modell-Routing fuer Agent-interne LLM-Calls (Condensing, Fast-Path-Planner/Presenter, plan_presentation, Recipe-Planner, ggf. Skill-Klassifikator) | Planned | Planned | EPIC-24, ADR-115, ADR-11 | RESEARCH-36 |  |  | 2026-05-12 | P2 Welle 3; ADR-115 |
| FEAT-24-08 | Feature | Autonomie-Governance: Token-/Kosten-Budget pro Task mit Pause+Rueckfrage, Steering-Hook zwischen Iterationen, weiches Exploration-Limit | Planned | Planned | EPIC-24, ADR-114, ADR-113 | RESEARCH-36 |  |  | 2026-05-12 | P2 Welle 3; ADR-114 (Subtask-Per-Call-Budget bleibt in ADR-113) |
| FEAT-24-09 | Feature | Active Skills: model-getriebenes On-demand-Laden statt Klassifikator-Inject | Planned | Planned | EPIC-24, ADR-116, ADR-62, ADR-09 | RESEARCH-36 |  |  | 2026-05-12 | P1 Welle 2; ADR-116; spart Klassifikator-Roundtrip + macht System-Prompt cache-stabil (ergaenzt ADR-62-Amendment) |
| FIX-24-01-01 | Fix | 01-01: anthropic.ts cache_control sitzt auf dem ganzen System-Prompt-String (inkl. volatilem DateTime/Memory/ActiveSkills/Recipe/VaultContext-Tail) -> Cache-Miss + 25% Write-Aufschlag, teurer als ohne Caching | Done | Building | FEAT-24-01, EPIC-24, ADR-62, PLAN-18 | BUG |  |  | 2026-05-12 | P0 Gefixt via FEAT-24-01: System-Prompt am CACHE_BREAKPOINT_MARKER gesplittet, cache_control nur auf dem stabilen Prefix; DateTime tagesgranular. |
| FIX-24-03-01 | Fix | 03-01: ResultExternalizer schliesst read_file aus + Agent liest die externalisierte tmp-Datei sofort zurueck -> No-Op (4/5 Messlauf-Tests); kompakte Referenz zu duenn + kein Re-Read-Cap; verallgemeinert FIX-18-02-01 | Done | Building | FEAT-24-03, EPIC-24, ADR-63, PLAN-18 | BUG |  |  | 2026-05-12 | P1 ResultExternalizer.isExternalizedPath + formatReReadCap (Re-Read einer eigenen tmp-Datei -> 2k-Head-Cap); reichere format*Ref (mehr Headings/Preview/Title). |
| FIX-24-03-02 | Fix | 03-02: tmp-Cleanup des ResultExternalizers schlaegt auf iCloud-Pfad mit EPERM fehl (non-fatal, tmp-Files bleiben liegen) | Done | Building | FEAT-24-03, EPIC-24, PLAN-18 | BUG |  |  | 2026-05-12 | P2 Bereits durch BUG-023 (removeWithRetry + cleanupOrphaned) abgedeckt; Kommentar-Referenz ergaenzt. Kein Verhaltenswechsel noetig. |
| IMP-24-05-01 | Improvement | 05-01: Per-API-Call Cache-Stat-Diagnose-Log (src/api/logCacheStat.ts) in alle Provider verdrahtet (ausser chatgpt-oauth) | Done | Building | FEAT-24-05, EPIC-24, IMP-18-01-02, PLAN-18 | USER |  |  | 2026-05-12 | Committed 4a5023a (PLAN-18 Task 1, zusammen mit dem 2026-05-11 max_tokens-Auto/Truncation-Recovery-Bugfix als chore-Baseline). Deckt nur das Log, NICHT das cached_tokens-Wiring in usage-Chunk + Cost-Calc -- das ist IMP-18-01-02 (PLAN-18 Task 5). |
