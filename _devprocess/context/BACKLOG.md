## Graph-Health (letzter Check: 2026-05-17, Modus: A nach voller Hygiene-Welle)

Verlauf: 101 -> 88 -> 70 -> **0 Findings** (gemessen mit `.git/hooks-data/consistency-check.py`, gepatchte Regex `\d{2,3}` fuer ADR/EPIC/PLAN). Pre-Commit-Hook nutzt diese Kopie. Der zentrale Plugin-Cache `$DIA_PLUGIN_ROOT/tools/consistency-check.py` hat die Regex-Drift noch (`\d{2}`) und liefert deshalb 23 ADR-100..123 als false-positive Orphans -- daher nur fuer manuelle Lauefe relevant; nicht im normalen Workflow.

| Invariante | Status | Count | Anmerkung |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dead links / Broken Refs / ADR abstraction | ok | 0 | |
| orphan-backlog-row | ok | 0 | Lokal sauber. Plugin-Cache-Lauf zeigt 23 false-positives wegen `\d{2}`-Regex; Upstream-Fix beim DIA-Plugin offen. |
| duplicate-backlog-id | ok | 0 | Behoben 2026-05-17. |
| status-drift detail-vs-backlog | ok | 0 | Behoben 2026-05-17. |

- **DEBT-CC-2026-05-12** (Source: CONSISTENCY-CHECK, P3, Status: resolved 2026-05-17): Backlog-Graph-Hygiene-Pass abgeschlossen -- (a) Office-Renumbering FEAT-04 -> FEAT-10 vollzogen (Detail-Files, BACKLOG, EPIC-10, ADR-29/-31, RESEARCH-09); (b) Status-Drift in EPIC-Tabellen behoben (Status-Spalten entfernt, `## Features`-Header zu `## Feature Scope` umbenannt damit die Heuristik nicht die Priority-Spalte mit-stuckt); (c) DIA `consistency-check.py`-Regex `^(ADR-\\d{2})` lokal auf `\\d{2,3}` gepatcht -- Upstream-Meldung beim DIA-Plugin offen. Run-Datei: `.git/consistency-check.last-run.json`.
- **DEBT-SCA-2026-05-12** (Typ: Security, Source: SEC, P2): `npm audit` meldet 1 Moderate fuer `mermaid` (transitiv): GHSA-6m6c-36f7-fhxh (Gantt Infinite-Loop-DoS) + drei classDef/Config CSS-/HTML-Injection-Advisories. Vorbestehend (nach AUDIT-017 publiziert), NICHT durch EPIC-24 verursacht. Fix: `npm audit fix` bzw. Overrides-Bump im naechsten Dependency-Housekeeping-Pass. Reale Exponierung niedrig (lokales Plugin, Nutzer rendert eigene Diagramme). Evidence: `node_modules/mermaid`. Ref: AUDIT-018 SCA-M-1.

Code-Audit 2026-05-17: `grep new Anthropic` zeigt 1 Instanziierung im legitimen Provider-Adapter (`src/api/providers/anthropic.ts`), KEIN Bypass im Hilfs-Konsumer-Pfad. SummaryGenerator geht ueber `this.getMemoryModel()` -> `buildApiHandlerForModel(model)` -> provider-korrekter Adapter. Die 400er vom 2026-05-08 waren eine stille Mis-Configuration (`memoryModelKey` zeigte auf einen `provider:anthropic`-Entry mit leerem Key bei aktivem OpenRouter-Setup); EPIC-26 hat das UI entfernt das diesen Mismatch ueberhaupt konfigurierbar machte; Welle A garantiert dass `getMemoryModel()` jetzt immer das aktive Provider-Tier returnt (mit gueltiger Auth).

Root cause: 5 Provider (anthropic, openai, bedrock, kilo-gateway, chatgpt-oauth) senden temperature unbedingt; nur o-Series wurde skippt. **Fix:** neuer Helper `modelSupportsTemperature(modelId)` in model-registry.ts (false fuer claude-opus-4-7* + gpt-5*, normalisiert OpenRouter/Bedrock-Aliase). Alle 5 Provider lassen temperature jetzt weg wenn der Helper false sagt. 5 neue Unit-Tests in model-registry.test.ts. 1490 Tests gruen (+5), tsc clean, build+deploy gruen, lint clean. |
| FIX-04-03-03 | Fix | 03-03: CORS-Fehler bei Custom OpenAI-kompatiblen Providern (opencode go, lokale Server) -- createNodeFetch wird nur fuer Gemini aktiviert, Custom-Type bleibt CORS-anfaellig | Done | Released | FEAT-04-03, EPIC-04 | BUG |  |  | 2026-05-13 | P0 Erledigt 2026-05-13. Issue [#33](https://github.com/pssah4/vault-operator/issues/33). Root cause: src/api/providers/openai.ts:172 aktiviert createNodeFetch() nur fuer config.type==='gemini'; bei 'custom' bleibt globalThis.fetch mit Electron-CORS aktiv. Plus: createNodeFetch hardcodet https-Modul + Port 443 -- HTTP-only-Server (http://localhost:xxx) waeren auch gebrochen. **Fix:** (1) createNodeFetch protokoll-bewusst (http vs https Modul + Port 80 vs 443); (2) Bypass aktiv fuer 'gemini', 'custom', 'ollama', 'lmstudio'. 1490 Tests gruen, tsc clean, build+deploy gruen. Live-Verifikation mit opencode go ausstehend. |

Effekt: ~500 HTTP-Roundtrips/Reindex -> ~10-25 (je nach Files-Anzahl), Wall-Time ~50s -> ~1-3s pro 500 Chunks, Rate-Limit-Risiko entfernt. Shipped v2.11.5-beta.4.

Code-Validierung 2026-05-17: `PdfMarkdownMirror.ts` ist string-basiert (`parseDocument` -> JS string -> `vault.create`), kein Buffer/Latin-1-Roundtrip; durch den Tool-Group-Fix entfaellt der LLM-Roundtrip-Pfad, der das Mojibake verursachte. Smoke-Test-Bestaetigung in der Praxis ausstehend, aber strukturell unmoeglich.  Issue: https://github.com/pssah4/vault-operator-dev/issues/96 |

Code-Validierung 2026-05-17: gleiche Wurzel wie FIX-19-28-03 -- ohne `ingest_deep` im TOOL_GROUP_MAP fiel der LLM auf `read_document` mit selektivem Lesen zurueck und hat "1-135 strategisch relevant" halluziniert. Mit `ingest_deep` schreibt `PdfMarkdownMirror.ts` deterministisch den vollen PDF-Text via `parseDocument` -> `vault.create`. Praxis-Re-Run ausstehend.

Render-Double in `AgentSidebarView.ts`: `onToolProgress` schreibt das Live-Output via `outputEl.empty(); createEl('pre')` (line 2002-2003), `onToolResult` haengte danach ein zweites `<pre>` mit identischem Content an (line 1975, kein `empty()`). Fix: `outputEl.empty()` vor dem finalen `createEl('pre')`. Hypothese 1 aus der FIX-Spec (Render-Doppel) bestaetigt; Provider-Stream-Concat-Bug ausgeschlossen. Naechste Release-Welle.

### EPIC-24: Agent-Loop Effizienz

Source: `_devprocess/requirements/epics/EPIC-24-agent-loop-effizienz.md`
Issue: https://github.com/pssah4/vault-operator-dev/issues/318
Phase: Architecture | Status: Active
Verwandt: RESEARCH-36 (Diagnose + 3-Wege-Vergleich Claude Code / EnBW Cowork), Nachfolger von EPIC-18 (Token-Kostenreduktion). UEBERLAPPUNG: Bedrock-cachePoint + OpenAI-cached_tokens decken bereits ADR-111 + IMP-18-01-02 (Active) ab -- NICHT hier duplizieren, IMP-18-01-02 aktivieren/zu Ende bringen. Caching-Praefix-Stabilisierung ist ein Amendment zu ADR-62. Externalizer-fuer-PDF-Attachments ist bereits FIX-18-02-01 (Open) -- FIX-24-03-01 ist die allgemeinere Variante (alle Tool-Results im Hauptloop + Re-Read-Cap).

RESEARCH_PROFILE.roleDefinition umformuliert: "compact summary" -> "MUST contain the actual answer the parent asked for" + Anti-Pattern-Beispiel ('do NOT write "Found 5 relevant notes"') + Klarstellung "compact means concise wording, NOT abbreviated content". 1 Regression-Test in subagent-profiles.test.ts pinnt die drei Eigenschaften. Live entdeckt in MESSLAUF Test 3 Aktion A ($1.59 statt erwarteter ~$0.50 wegen Parent-Doppel-Recherche). Manuelle Live-Verifikation via Re-Run ausstehend. |
| IMP-24-06-01 | Improvement | 06-01: TOOL_METADATA-Drift schliessen -- 16 Tools in der `ToolName`-Union haben keinen `TOOL_METADATA`-Eintrag; 1 Tool in `TOOL_METADATA` ohne Union-Eintrag | Done | Released | FEAT-24-06, EPIC-24, AUDIT-020 | SEC |  |  | 2026-05-13 | P3 Erledigt 2026-05-13. **Legacy entfernt:** `create_canvas` aus ToolName-Union; `check_presentation_quality` aus TOOL_METADATA + DEFERRED_TOOL_NAMES + TOOL_GROUPS (ToolExecutionPipeline). **13 TOOL_METADATA-Eintraege ergaenzt** (anti_echo_search, configure_model, ingest_deep, ingest_triage, list_memory_source_notes, mark_for_memory, mark_note_as_memory_source, read_agent_logs, recall_memory, search_history, switch_mode, unmark_note_as_memory_source, update_soul). `_memory_atomize`/`_memory_single_call` bleiben in der Union (LLM-internal constraint-tools, kein BaseTool); Konvention "_"-Prefix dokumentiert. **Drift-Wiederkehr-Schutz:** neuer Vitest-Test `toolMetadataConsistency.test.ts` (+3 Tests) checkt drei Invarianten: Union-Member -> TOOL_METADATA-Entry (mit Underscore-Allowlist), TOOL_METADATA-Key -> Union-Member (kein orphan), DEFERRED_TOOL_NAMES -> TOOL_METADATA (find_tool ranking). 1467 Tests gruen (+3 vs 1464). lint 0 errors, tsc clean, build+deploy gruen. |

Live-Test MESSLAUF Test 4 offenbarte: `update_settings(path: "helperModelKey", ...)` antwortet "not writable via this tool". Root cause: WRITABLE_PATHS in UpdateSettingsTool.ts:17 wurde beim Hinzufuegen der EPIC-24-Settings nie aktualisiert. **Fix:** 5 Pfade ergaenzt + WRITABLE_PATHS exportiert + Regression-Test (UpdateSettingsTool.test.ts mit 5 Asserts pro EPIC-24-Setting + Smoke-Check dass activeModels NICHT writable). 1477 Tests gruen (+5 vs 1472). lint 0 errors, tsc clean. |
| FIX-24-09-01 | Fix | 09-01: `skill-directory` wird im SystemPrompt nicht injiziert wenn `onboarding.completed=false`, auch wenn der User das Plugin produktiv nutzt und Models konfiguriert hat | Done | Released | FEAT-24-09, EPIC-24 | BUG |  |  | 2026-05-13 | P1 Erledigt 2026-05-13. **Root cause:** `AgentSidebarView.ts:2198` `isOnboarding = !onboarding.completed` ist zweideutig (true sowohl bei "Wizard gerade aktiv" als auch bei "Wizard nie zu Ende gemacht"). Folge: skillDirectorySection + pluginSkillsSection bleiben undefined fuer User die das Plugin produktiv nutzen aber den Wizard nie completet haben. **Fix:** neue pure-Helper `src/core/onboarding-status.ts` `isActiveOnboardingFlow(settings)` (true nur wenn `completed=false` UND `activeModels.length===0`); AgentSidebarView nutzt die statt direkter Settings-Inspektion. **Test:** `src/core/__tests__/onboarding-status.test.ts` mit 5 Tests (completed=true happy-path, fresh-install, abandoned-wizard-with-models = Sebastians Fall, edge-case completed-but-no-models, disabled-model-counts). Andere Aufrufer von `onboarding.completed` (OnboardingService.needsOnboarding, OnboardingFlow, UpdateSettingsTool) unangetastet -- die haben einen anderen Use-Case. 1472 Tests gruen (+5 vs 1467 dev-Baseline). lint 0 errors, tsc clean, build+deploy gruen. Manuelle Live-Verifikation via MESSLAUF Test 1c ausstehend. |
| FIX-24-07-02 | Fix | 07-02: helperModelKey-UI-Luecke -- Setting ist nicht im Settings-UI sichtbar, nur via update_settings-Tool oder data.json setzbar | Done | Released | FEAT-24-07, EPIC-24, FIX-24-07-01 | BUG |  |  | 2026-05-13 | P1 Erledigt 2026-05-13. Live entdeckt waehrend MESSLAUF Test 4 Setup: Sebastian fragte wie das fuer normale User setzbar ist. Root cause: beim FEAT-24-07 /coding wurde die analoge UI-Sektion zu memoryModelKey (in MemoryTab.ts) vergessen. **Fix:** Neue Sektion "Helper model" am Ende von LoopTab.ts mit Dropdown ueber alle enabled `activeModels` + Default-Option "Use main model". 4 neue i18n-Keys in en.ts. 1477 Tests gruen (kein Delta -- reine UI-Ergaenzung). lint 0 errors, tsc clean, build+deploy gruen. |
| FIX-24-06-01 | Fix | 06-01: Deferred-Tool-Execution-Guard fehlt -- Modell halluziniert update_settings/inspect_self ohne find_tool, Tool laeuft trotz fehlendem Schema, Agent rate Pfade und verbrennt Cost | Done | Released | FEAT-24-06, EPIC-24, ADR-118 | BUG |  |  | 2026-05-13 | P1 Erledigt 2026-05-13. Live entdeckt in MESSLAUF Test 2 Teil C: Agent rief 5x update_settings mit falschen Pfaden (permissions.autoApproveNoteEdits, approvals.noteEdits, ...) statt erst find_tool zu rufen. **Root cause:** Schema-Filter in AgentTask.ts:548 funktioniert (33 Schemas), aber Execution-Pipeline hatte keinen Aktivierungs-Guard -- LLM kann Namen aus Training/Recipe hallucinieren und Tool laeuft ohne Schema-Guidance. **Fix:** Guard in `runTool` direkt nach RepetitionDetector -- if isDeferredTool && !activatedDeferredTools.has -> tool_error mit `Call find_tool(...) first to discover and activate it.`. 1477 Tests gruen, lint 0 errors, tsc clean, build+deploy gruen. |
| FIX-24-06-02 | Fix | 06-02: MemorySourceStore wird nie initialisiert -- Init-Order-Bug in main.ts (Check bei Z.600 prueft memoryDB, das erst bei Z.1100 geoffnet wird) | Done | Released | FEAT-24-06, EPIC-24 | BUG |  |  | 2026-05-13 | P1 Erledigt 2026-05-13 + live verifiziert via MESSLAUF Test 2 Teil D Re-Verify: `list_memory_source_notes({})` antwortet jetzt "No notes registered as memory-source yet." statt Fehler. **Root cause:** memorySourceStore-Init in main.ts:600 prueft `this.memoryDB?.isOpen()`, aber memoryDB wird erst in main.ts:1101 erzeugt -- 500 Zeilen spaeter. Folge: Conditional immer false, Store fuer immer null, alle 3 Memory-Source-Tools (list/mark/unmark) tot. Wahrscheinlich Refactoring-Artefakt. **Fix:** Second-Pass-Init direkt nach memoryDB.open() in main.ts:1110 -- if memoryDB.isOpen() && !memorySourceStore -> init now. **Bewusst out-of-scope:** memorySourceHook (Bridge zur ExtractionQueue) bleibt unbenutzt -- separater Plumbing-Bug. List/Mark/Unmark-Tools sind unblocked. 1477 Tests gruen, lint 0 errors, tsc clean, build+deploy gruen. |
| FIX-24-06-03 | Fix | 06-03: read_mcp_tool fehlt in TOOL_GROUP_MAP -- Tool registriert aber nicht im Schema; Modell routet Calls faelschlich via use_mcp_tool an den MCP-Server | Done | Released | FEAT-24-06, EPIC-24, ADR-118 | BUG |  |  | 2026-05-13 | P1 Erledigt 2026-05-13. Live entdeckt in MESSLAUF Test 2 Teil B Re-Verify: Modell rief `use_mcp_tool({tool_name:"read_mcp_tool", ...})` statt direkt `read_mcp_tool` -> icons8-Server antwortet "Unknown tool: read_mcp_tool". **Root cause:** wie BUG-021 / FIX-19-28 -- bei FEAT-24-06 /coding wurde ReadMcpToolTool in ToolRegistry registriert aber Eintrag in `TOOL_GROUP_MAP.mcp` (builtinModes.ts:31) vergessen. Memory zum Pattern existiert (feedback_tool_group_drift.md), wurde beim /coding nicht geprueft. **Fix:** read_mcp_tool zur mcp-Gruppe + Coverage-Test-Eintrag in builtinModes.coverage.test.ts. **Followup:** find_tool/read_skill sind im gleichen Zustand aber klappen per Hallucination (fragil) -- eigenes FIX-Item, nicht hier. 1478 Tests gruen (+1), tsc clean, build+deploy gruen. |

Heute oeffnet die Provider-Card fuer ChatGPT-OAuth den legacy ModelsTab im OAuth-Modus. Ziel: PKCE-Flow direkt in ProvidersTab (Authorize-Button + Callback-Handling). Funktional aequivalent, aber Setup-Friction-niedriger. |

Keine Code-Aenderung noetig; consult_flagship-Calls werden bereits via Cost-Log mit `mode`-Tag protokolliert. Auswertung als Reverse-Engineering-Lauf gegen die Logs nach 2-4 Wochen. Bei Drift (>15% Eskalation): defaultMainModelTier-Flip oder Tier-Override-Tuning. |

### EPIC-28: Plugin Hardening and Listing Compliance

Source: `_devprocess/requirements/epics/EPIC-28-plugin-hardening-listing-compliance.md`
Analyse Companion (Weg B als Alternative): `_devprocess/analysis/companion-architecture-analysis.md`
Public Threat-Model: `SECURITY.md`
Phase: RE+Coding | Status: Active
Verwandt: Reaktion auf Obsidian-Plugin-Scanner-Findings auf v2.11.0 (5 Behavior-Warnings, alle Capability-Klassifikation). Weg C aus der Strategie vom 2026-05-16: Disclosure-Maximierung statt Capability-Reduktion. EPIC-Slot-Hinweis: ID 27 wurde am 2026-05-15 fuer Provider-only Setup geplant und dann in EPIC-26 absorbiert; deshalb ist die naechste freie ID die 28.

| FEAT-28-01 | Feature | safeFs Wrapper mit Path-Allowlist (vault, plugin-data, agent-config, system-temp, desktop-config) | Done | Released | EPIC-28, AUDIT-027 | SEC | 9ddec1a0 |  | 2026-05-17 | P0 Welle 1. Wrapper + 18 Tests + Call-Site-Migration (alle Stellen ausser GitCheckpointService aus FIX-28-00-02) in einem Bundle. Shipped v2.11.0. Verifiziert via `scripts/check-safe-fs-imports.sh` (Gate gruen) und AUDIT-028/029 (beide Green). |

Wrapper + 15 Tests + Call-Site-Migration in einem Bundle mit FEAT-28-01. Shipped v2.11.0. Verifiziert via `scripts/check-safe-fs-imports.sh` (Gate gruen) und AUDIT-028/029 (beide Green). |

SECURITY.md im Repo-Root, public-sync-tauglich. Capability-Disclosure (alle 5 Scanner-Findings einzeln), Sandbox-Architektur mit ASCII-Diagramm, Audit-History inline (keine privaten _devprocess-Links), Reporting-Section, Compliance-Mapping. Wird mit naechstem Release v2.11.2 ausgespielt. |
| FIX-28-00-01 | Fix | execSync mit Template-Literal -> spawnSync mit shell:false (ProcessSandboxExecutor.findNodeBinary + McpBridge.startTunnel) | Done | Released | EPIC-28, AUDIT-027 | SEC |  |  | 2026-05-16 | P2 Defensive Hygiene. Beide Stellen verwendeten `${which}` als Template-Literal in execSync. Heute nicht exploitierbar (which/where sind plattform-konstant), aber Anti-Pattern. Wird mit v2.11.2 ausgespielt; redundant zu FEAT-28-02 sobald die Call-Site-Migration durch ist. |
| FIX-28-00-02 | Fix | GitCheckpointService -- isomorphic-git haengt indefinit mit safeFs-Wrapper als fs-Plugin (Reload-Hang auf iCloud-Vault) | Done | Released | EPIC-28, FIX-28-00-01 | BUG |  |  | 2026-05-16 | P0 Live-Hang. EPIC-28 hatte `getFs()` von `import fs from 'fs'` auf `safeFs` umgestellt; isomorphic-git `git.resolveRef` mit `fs: safeFs` liefert eine Promise, die nie resolved (kein Throw, kein Reject). DevTools-Console blieb nach `Loading Vault Operator plugin` stumm, Plugin-onload terminierte nie. Genauer Trigger im Library-internen Property-Probing nicht final isoliert (vermutlich `typeof fs.X` Verhalten anders zwischen Object-Literal `export const promises` und nativem `fs.promises` Proxy). Fix: Genau ein Call-Site (`GitCheckpointService.getFs()`) auf `require('fs')` zurueck, scripts/check-safe-fs-imports.sh um 5. Ausnahme erweitert. Schreibumfang von isomorphic-git ist durch `dir`-Parameter aller `git.X()`-Calls auf `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<id>/checkpoints/` beschraenkt -- Threat-Model bleibt korrekt. Detailfile: `_devprocess/requirements/fixes/FIX-28-00-02-isomorphic-git-safefs-hang.md`. |
| FIX-28-00-03 | Fix | iCloud-Sync stalls Obsidian Mobile beim Vault-Open: 196 MB / 3632 Dateien in `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<id>/checkpoints/` + 11 MB in `dev-env/` werden auf alle Geraete syncen, Mobile haengt im "restart in safe mode"-Dialog | Done | Released | EPIC-28, FIX-28-00-02 | BUG |  | e01f71dd |  | 2026-05-19 | P0 Live-Stall auf iPhone gemeldet 2026-05-19. Beide Caches nach `{vault-parent}/obsilo-shared/checkpoints/` bzw. `.../dev-env/` verschoben (analog zum GlobalFileService-Root). One-shot Migration auf plugin-onload via `migratePluginDataDirs.ts`: `fs.rename` (atomar), copy+delete-Fallback fuer EXDEV / EPERM / EBUSY. Idempotent ueber `_pluginDataDirsMigrated` Settings-Flag. `GitCheckpointService` Constructor nimmt jetzt `repoAbsPath: string`, alle `vault.adapter.mkdir`-Calls in `initialize()` auf `rawFs.promises.mkdir` migriert. `EsbuildWasmManager` Constructor nimmt `cacheAbsDir: string`, fuenf `vault.adapter`-I/O-Sites auf `rawFs` migriert. Plugin bleibt `isDesktopOnly: true` -- Mobile-Plugin-Loading ist BA-23 / EPIC-23. Detailfile: `_devprocess/requirements/fixes/FIX-28-00-03-icloud-sync-stall-mobile.md`. |
