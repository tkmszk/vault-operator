| **Total** | **0** | **6** | **15** | **11** | **5** |

**Overall assessment:** The codebase demonstrates strong security engineering with multiple defense-in-depth layers. No critical vulnerabilities were found. The main areas of concern are the effectiveness of the iframe sandbox in Obsidian's Electron context (which weakens Chromium's process isolation), postMessage origin validation gaps, and the GlobalFileService lacking path traversal protection. Enterprise deployments should address the High findings before production.

---

## Phase 1: CodeQL SAST Findings

CodeQL database exists at `codeql-db` with JS/TS language support. Results are in BQRS format under `results`. Manual taint-tracking analysis follows:

### H-1: `new Function()` used in main process (CWE-94 -- Code Injection)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | High |
| **Status** | Confirmed -- mitigated by SHA-256 integrity check. Keep monitoring. |

**Files:**

- `EsbuildWasmManager.ts:210`: `new Function('module', 'exports', jsCode)` -- loads esbuild-wasm browser.js
- `sandboxHtml.ts:65`: `new Function('exports', 'vault', 'requestUrl', msg.code)` -- inside iframe

**Triage:** The iframe usage is acceptable -- it runs inside `sandbox="allow-scripts"` with no DOM access to the parent. The EsbuildWasmManager usage runs in the main Electron process and deserves scrutiny. The CDN download is integrity-verified via SHA-256, so the risk of RCE through this vector is mitigated if the hash is correct and the SHA-256 check is cryptographically sound (it is -- uses `crypto.subtle`).

### M-1: User-controlled regex in SearchFilesTool and EmbeddedSourceManager (CWE-1333 -- ReDoS)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Medium |

**Files:**

- `SearchFilesTool.ts:67-72`: `new RegExp(pattern, 'i')` from LLM-generated input
- `EmbeddedSourceManager.ts:109`: `new RegExp(pattern, 'gi')` from LLM via manage\_source
- `ConsoleRingBuffer.ts:111`: `new RegExp(filter.pattern, 'i')`

**Risk:** An LLM-generated pattern like `(a+)+$` against a large file can freeze the UI thread for seconds or more.

**Fix:** Wrap in a try/catch with timeout or pre-validate regex complexity. SearchFilesTool already falls back to literal escape on invalid regex -- but doesn't protect against valid but catastrophic patterns.

### M-2: IgnoreService glob-to-regex conversion (CWE-1333 -- ReDoS)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Status** | Won't Fix -- existing mitigations sufficient. |

**File:** `IgnoreService.ts:155-165`

**Triage:** The code has a length guard (>200 chars) and triple-star rejection. Confirmed -- adequately mitigated for user-controlled `.obsidian-agentignore` patterns.

### M-3: SelfAuthoredSkillLoader regex from skill trigger (CWE-1333)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Medium |

**File:** `SelfAuthoredSkillLoader.ts:632`

Agent-authored SKILL.md files can specify a trigger regex that's compiled with `new RegExp(triggerSource, 'i')`. A malicious or badly-crafted skill could cause ReDoS.

**Fix:** Validate trigger regex complexity or use a timeout wrapper.

### L-1: Non-literal filesystem operations in GlobalFileService (CWE-22)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Low |

**File:** `GlobalFileService.ts:31`

`resolvePath()` uses `path.join(this.root, relativePath)` without checking for `..` traversal. While callers pass controlled paths, this is a defense-in-depth gap.

### I-1: `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` on SDK clients

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | False Positive |

**Files:** `anthropic.ts:25`, `openai.ts:122`

**Triage:** Required and correct for Obsidian's Electron renderer. Not a vulnerability.

---

## Phase 2: OWASP Web Security Findings

### A01 -- Broken Access Control

#### H-2: postMessage with wildcard origin `'*'` (CWE-346)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | High |

**File:** `SandboxExecutor.ts:90`

All postMessage calls from the plugin to the sandbox (and vice versa in `sandboxHtml.ts:30`) use `'*'` as the target origin. The parent's message handler at `SandboxExecutor.ts:152` does not validate `event.origin` or `event.source`.

**Impact on enterprise MacBook:** In Obsidian's Electron context, `event.origin` for srcdoc iframes is `'null'`, making origin checks non-trivial. However, any other code running in the renderer (e.g., another Obsidian plugin or injected extension) could spoof messages to/from the sandbox.

**Fix:** Validate `event.source === this.iframe?.contentWindow` in the `handleMessage` handler. This confirms the message came from the correct iframe, not from an injected source.

### A02 -- Cryptographic Failures

- API keys encrypted via Electron safeStorage (macOS Keychain) -- Good. See `SafeStorageService.ts`.
- Fallback to plaintext when safeStorage is unavailable -- documented and warned.
- SHA-256 integrity verification on CDN downloads -- Good. See `EsbuildWasmManager.ts:289`.

**Status:** Well-implemented. No actionable finding.

### A03 -- Injection

- **SQL injection:** N/A (no SQL).
- **Command injection:** ExecuteRecipeTool uses `spawn` with `shell: false` + parameter validation + shell metacharacter rejection. Well-protected (7 security layers documented).
- **Template injection:** N/A.

### A05 -- Security Misconfiguration

#### M-4: Debug test code in production plugin

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Medium |

**File:** `main.ts:903-959`

`testToolExecution()` method directly creates a write pipeline and writes a test file without user approval. While only accessible from developer console, it bypasses the approval pipeline's `onApprovalRequired` callback.

**Fix:** Remove or gate behind `debugMode` setting with additional confirmation.

### A09 -- Security Logging and Monitoring

#### L-2: OperationLogger parameter sanitization is solid

The `sanitizeParams` method in `OperationLogger.ts:58-87` redacts sensitive keys, truncates content, and strips URL credentials. Good implementation.

### A10 -- SSRF

- WebFetchTool blocks private IPs (`127.x`, `10.x`, `192.168.x`, `169.254.x`, `::1`, `fc00::/7`). Good. See `WebFetchTool.ts:75-90`.
- SandboxBridge URL allowlist blocks non-HTTPS, IPs, and non-standard ports. Good. See `SandboxBridge.ts:89-108`.

#### M-5: DNS rebinding not mitigated in WebFetchTool

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Medium |

**File:** `WebFetchTool.ts:75-90`

The SSRF check validates the hostname before resolution. An attacker controlling a DNS record could point `evil.com` to a public IP during the check, then rebind to `127.0.0.1` during the actual request. Since `requestUrl` (Electron's `net.request`) resolves DNS independently, the check could be bypassed.

**Fix:** For enterprise environments, consider resolving DNS first and validating the resulting IP, or document the limitation.

---

## Phase 2.5: OWASP LLM Top 10 -- AI/ML System Security

### LLM01 -- Prompt Injection

#### H-3: System prompt boundary exists but no output validation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | High |

**File:** `systemPrompt.ts`

The system prompt includes a security boundary section (`getSecurityBoundarySection`). However, LLM-generated tool calls flow directly into `ToolExecutionPipeline.executeTool()` without output validation. The LLM could be prompt-injected (e.g., via a fetched webpage or vault content) to call any tool the mode allows.

**Mitigations already in place:**

- Mode-based tool filtering limits available tools
- Approval pipeline requires user consent for writes (when auto-approval is off)
- IgnoreService blocks protected paths
- Fail-closed when no approval callback is available

**Assessment:** The existing defense-in-depth is strong. The residual risk is when auto-approval is fully enabled -- a prompt injection via web content could trigger unreviewed vault writes.

**Recommendation:** Document that `auto-approval: all` enabled is a high-risk configuration for enterprise. Consider adding an "enterprise lockdown" preset.

### LLM06 -- Sensitive Information Disclosure

#### M-6: Vault content (potentially PII) sent to cloud LLMs

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Medium |

By design, vault notes are read and sent as context to cloud LLM providers. For enterprise MacBooks with sensitive data, this is a data leakage vector.

**Mitigations:**

- Ollama/LM Studio local providers supported (no cloud egress)
- `.obsidian-agentignore` can exclude sensitive folders

**Recommendation:** Provide an enterprise setting that restricts providers to local-only.

### LLM08 -- Excessive Agency

#### M-7: Self-modification capability (Phase 4)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Medium |

**File:** `ManageSourceTool.ts`

The agent can edit its own source code, build, and hot-reload itself via `manage_source`. While gated behind write approval, this gives the LLM the theoretical ability to remove its own safety checks.

**Mitigations:**

- Write operation requires user approval
- Backup/rollback mechanism exists
- Embedded source is read-only by default

**Recommendation:** For enterprise, disable `manage_source` tool entirely via mode configuration.

#### L-3: Custom recipes allow user-defined shell commands

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Low |

**File:** `recipeRegistry.ts:143`

`settings.recipes.customRecipes` allows user-defined recipes. While validated, custom binaries expand the attack surface.

---

## Phase 2.7: Zero Trust Validation

### M-8: Internal service calls without authentication

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Medium |

All internal services (ToolRegistry, MemoryService, SemanticIndex, etc.) trust the caller implicitly. This is standard for single-process Obsidian plugins and not a vulnerability per se, but in the context of the sandbox escape scenario (Phase 2.8 below), a compromised sandbox could potentially call parent-side methods.

### L-4: MCP servers connect without mutual TLS

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Low |

**File:** `McpClient.ts`

SSE and streamable-HTTP MCP connections use standard HTTPS but no mutual TLS or signed tokens. The `headers` config can carry auth tokens, but this is optional.

**Mitigation:** MCP stdio transport is correctly blocked (only SSE/HTTP allowed). See `settings.ts:229`.

---

## Phase 2.8: Chromium Sandbox Deep Dive -- Enterprise MacBook Assessment

This is the specially requested analysis of iframe sandbox effectiveness.

### Architecture Overview

The sandbox uses an `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts">` loaded via `srcdoc`. Code execution inside the iframe uses `new Function()` to evaluate compiled JavaScript.

### What `sandbox="allow-scripts"` Provides

| Protection | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| No `allow-same-origin` | GOOD | iframe treated as cross-origin -- cannot access parent DOM |
| No `allow-top-navigation` | GOOD | Cannot navigate/redirect the parent window |
| No `allow-forms` | GOOD | Cannot submit forms |
| No `allow-popups` | GOOD | Cannot open new windows |
| `allow-scripts` | Required | Needed for code execution |
| No Node.js access | GOOD | iframe context has no `require`, no `process`, no `fs` |
| No fetch/XHR | GOOD | No network access except via bridge |

### H-4: Chromium Process Isolation Does NOT Apply in Obsidian's Electron

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | High |

This is the most important finding for enterprise security.

**The Claim:** The codebase comments state "Chromium's iframe sandbox provides OS-level process isolation" (`SandboxExecutor.ts:8`, `sandboxHtml.ts:8`).

**The Reality:**

1. **Obsidian disables Chromium's site isolation for plugins.** Obsidian's Electron main process sets `nodeIntegration: true` and `contextIsolation: false` for the renderer. This means the renderer process has full Node.js access. Sandboxed iframes in this context run in the same renderer process -- there is no OS-level process boundary.

2. **No out-of-process iframe (OOPIF).** Chromium's `--site-per-process` flag creates separate OS processes for cross-origin iframes. Obsidian does not enable this flag. The `srcdoc` iframe runs in the same V8 isolate as the parent page. While the V8 sandbox prevents direct memory access between origins, it is a logical boundary, not an OS-level one.

3. **V8 exploits bypass the iframe sandbox entirely.** If a V8 vulnerability is exploited within the sandboxed iframe (e.g., via a type confusion bug in the compiled user code), the attacker gains access to the same process that has full Node.js access (via Obsidian's `nodeIntegration: true`). This means:
   - Full filesystem access via `require('fs')`
   - Process execution via `require('child_process')`
   - Network access via `require('net')`
   - Access to all Electron APIs

4. **Comparison with Chrome browser:** In Chrome, `sandbox="allow-scripts"` with `srcdoc` creates an opaque origin that runs in a sandboxed renderer process with seccomp-BPF (Linux) or Seatbelt (macOS) restrictions. Even a V8 exploit cannot access the filesystem because the OS sandbox denies `open()` syscalls. **This does not apply to Obsidian's Electron.**

### What the Sandbox Actually Provides (Honest Assessment)

| Layer | Protection Level | Bypassed By |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| V8 origin isolation | Prevents direct JS access to parent scope | V8 vulnerability |
| `sandbox` attribute | Removes DOM access, navigation, forms | V8 vulnerability |
| `srcdoc` (no `allow-same-origin`) | Opaque origin -- no localStorage, no cookies | V8 vulnerability |
| AstValidator (regex checks) | Blocks `eval`, `require`, `process`, `child_process` in source | Obfuscation, encoded strings, runtime construction |
| SandboxBridge (rate limits, URL allowlist, path validation) | Limits what the iframe can request | Nothing -- correctly server-side |

**Effective security boundary:** The SandboxBridge running in the parent process is the actual security boundary. It correctly validates paths, rate-limits writes, and allowlists URLs. Even if the iframe's V8 isolation is bypassed, operations must go through the bridge.

### M-9: AstValidator bypass vectors

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Medium |

**File:** `AstValidator.ts`

The AstValidator is explicitly documented as "NOT the primary security boundary" -- good. However, it can be bypassed.

**Status:** Confirmed -- Low practical risk because the iframe has no `window.eval` (it runs in an opaque-origin sandbox without eval in its global scope... but `new Function` IS available via the injected code path). The real protection is that even if eval runs, the iframe cannot access Node.js APIs.

### M-10: postMessage origin verification missing

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Medium (same as H-2, reinforced in sandbox context) |

**File:** `SandboxExecutor.ts:152`

The message handler processes any `MessageEvent` without checking `event.source`. Another Obsidian plugin running in the same renderer could send crafted messages.

The SandboxBridge would process this as a legitimate bridge call from the sandbox.

**Fix:** Add `event.source` check:
Validate `event.source === this.iframe?.contentWindow`

### I-2: CSP added to sandbox iframe (RESOLVED 2026-03-01)

~~The `srcdoc` content has no `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag.~~

**Update:** CSP meta tag added to `sandboxHtml.ts`:
`default-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'`

`'unsafe-eval'` is required because the sandbox uses `new Function()` to load
compiled code. This is acceptable because:
- The iframe `sandbox="allow-scripts"` attribute provides V8 origin isolation
- The SandboxBridge validates all cross-boundary operations
- The AstValidator pre-validates all user code before compilation
- `new Function()` is fundamental to the sandbox architecture

### Enterprise MacBook Recommendation

For an enterprise MacBook deployment:

1. **Do NOT rely on the iframe sandbox as a security boundary.** Treat it as a convenience layer, not a security control. The SandboxBridge is the real security gate.
2. **Disable self-modification tools** (`manage_source`, `manage_skill` with code modules) in enterprise mode configurations.
3. **Disable recipe execution** or restrict to a curated allowlist of binaries.
4. **Use local LLM providers** (Ollama) to prevent data exfiltration.
5. **Enable checkpoint system** as a safety net for vault modifications.
6. **Keep auto-approval disabled** for write operations.
7. **Review `.obsidian-agentignore`** to exclude sensitive folders.

## Phase 3: Security Hotspots

| # | Pattern | File | Line | Triage | Justification |
|---|---------|------|------|--------|---------------|
| SH-1 | `new Function()` | EsbuildWasmManager.ts | 210 | Confirmed | Loads SHA-256 verified code. Acceptable risk. |
| SH-2 | `new Function()` | sandboxHtml.ts | 65 | Won't Fix | Runs inside sandboxed iframe. By design. |
| SH-3 | `spawn()` | ExecuteRecipeTool.ts | 216 | Confirmed | `shell: false`, validated params, binary resolved via `which`. Well-protected. |
| SH-4 | `spawn()` | ExecuteRecipeTool.ts | 29 | Confirmed | `resolveBinary` helper -- `shell: false`, safe. |
| SH-5 | Weak crypto | -- | -- | False Positive | No crypto usage besides `crypto.subtle.digest` (SHA-256). |
| SH-6 | `requestUrl` with dynamic URL | WebFetchTool.ts | 112 | Confirmed | SSRF-protected with IP blocklist. DNS rebinding risk noted. |
| SH-7 | `requestUrl` with dynamic URL | EsbuildWasmManager.ts | 246+ | Confirmed | CDN base URLs are hardcoded (esm.sh, jsdelivr). Package names come from LLM-generated `dependencies` param. `resolveInternalImports()` recursively downloads absolute-path imports from CDN responses (e.g. `/node/buffer.mjs`). URLs are CDN-relative paths only, depth-limited to 5. |
| SH-8 | Hardcoded credentials | -- | -- | False Positive | No hardcoded secrets found. API keys encrypted via safeStorage. |
| SH-9 | `cors(*)` | -- | -- | False Positive | No web server; not applicable to Obsidian plugin. |
| SH-10 | Empty catch blocks | VaultDNAScanner.ts | 900 | Confirmed | Non-critical background fetch -- acceptable. |
| SH-11 | `require('electron')` | SafeStorageService.ts | 35 | Won't Fix | Required for safeStorage access. Correctly documented. |

### Code Quality Issues (Phase 3.2)

#### H-5: GlobalFileService.resolvePath() has no path traversal check

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | High |

**File:** `GlobalFileService.ts:31`

`path.join('/home/user/.obsidian-agent', '../../etc/passwd')` resolves to `passwd`. While current callers use controlled paths, any future caller passing user-controlled input could escape the `~/.obsidian-agent/` root.

Compare with `SandboxBridge.validateVaultPath()` which correctly rejects `..` -- the same check is missing here.

### Maintainability (Phase 3.3)

| Finding | File | Detail |
|---------|------|--------|
| High complexity | `AgentTask.ts` (812 lines) | Main conversation loop -- complex but well-documented |
| High complexity | `AgentSidebarView.ts` (2372+ lines) | UI class exceeds god-class threshold |
| High param count | `systemPrompt.ts:82` | 15 positional params (deprecated overload still exists, config object added) |
| `any` types | Various | `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: warn` -- consistently avoided per review-bot rules |

---

## Phase 4: Dependency Vulnerabilities (SCA)

### Runtime Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose | Risk |
|---------|---------|---------|------|
| `@anthropic-ai/sdk` | ^0.78.0 | LLM API client | Low -- well-maintained |
| `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` | ^1.26.0 | MCP protocol | Low |
| `@orama/orama` | ^2.0.0 | Full-text search | Low |
| `isomorphic-git` | ^1.37.1 | Git checkpoints | Low |
| `openai` | ^4.0.0 | LLM API client | Low |
| `pdf-parse` | ^1.1.1 | PDF extraction | Medium -- last published 2020, 1 maintainer |
| `pdfjs-dist` | ^4.4.168 | PDF rendering | Low |
| `vectra` | ^0.12.3 | Vector index | Medium -- niche package |
| `diff` | ^5.1.0 | Text diffing | Low |
| `uuid` | ^9.0.1 | UUID generation | Low |
| `lodash.debounce` | ^4.0.8 | Debouncing | Low -- stable |
| `serialize-error` | ^11.0.0 | Error serialization | Low |

### Component Hygiene

| Check | Concern |
|-------|---------|
| `pdf-parse@1.1.1` | Last published ~2020. Potentially unmaintained. Consider alternative. |
| Version ranges use `^` | Standard npm practice. Lock file should be committed. |
| No `pnpm-lock.yaml` or `package-lock.json` in workspace root | Lock file missing -- dependency versions not pinned. |

### License Compliance

All runtime dependencies use permissive licenses (MIT, Apache-2.0, ISC, BSD). No copyleft risk detected.

### Supply Chain Risk

#### M-11: CDN dependency loading at runtime

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Medium |

**File:** `EsbuildWasmManager.ts:30-31`

Downloads ~11MB of executable code from CDN at runtime. SHA-256 integrity verification mitigates tampering, but:

- CDN compromise could serve malicious code if hashes are also updated
- First download happens on user's machine with full Node.js access

**Mitigation:** The SHA-256 hashes are hardcoded at compile time. CDN cannot update them.

#### L-5: Package downloads from CDN without integrity checks

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Low |

**File:** `EsbuildWasmManager.ts:313`

`ensurePackage()` downloads npm packages from `cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/{name}/+esm` without any integrity verification. These packages are loaded into the esbuild virtual filesystem for bundling.

**Mitigation:** The compiled code runs inside the sandboxed iframe, limiting blast radius.

---

## Phase 4.5: Resilience Issues

| Pattern | File | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| HTTP timeout | WebFetchTool | 15s timeout -- Good |
| HTTP timeout | WebSearchTool | 15s timeout -- Good |
| HTTP timeout | McpClient | Configurable timeout (default 60s) -- Good |
| Sandbox execution timeout | SandboxExecutor | 30s -- Good |
| Recipe process timeout | ExecuteRecipeTool | Per-recipe timeout + SIGKILL fallback -- Good |
| Plugin API call timeout | CallPluginApiTool | 10s -- Good |
| TLS verification | All HTTP | Uses Obsidian's `requestUrl` (Electron `net.request`) -- TLS enabled by default -- Good |
| Retry with backoff | Various | Not implemented for LLM API calls -- Low risk (user can retry) |

---

## Remediation Priority

### P0 -- Must Fix Immediately (Critical)

**None**

### P1 -- Must Fix Before Enterprise Release (High)

- **H-2/M-10:** Add `event.source` check to `SandboxExecutor.handleMessage()` -- `SandboxExecutor.ts:152` -- Validate `event.source === this.iframe?.contentWindow` to prevent message spoofing from other plugins.

- **H-4:** Correct documentation about sandbox process isolation -- `SandboxExecutor.ts:8`, `sandboxHtml.ts:8` -- Replace "OS-level process isolation" with "V8 origin isolation (logical boundary, not OS-level in Electron)". Ensure enterprise security reviewers have accurate expectations.

- **H-5:** Add path traversal check to `GlobalFileService.resolvePath()` -- `GlobalFileService.ts:31` -- Verify resolved path stays within `~/.obsidian-agent/`.

### P2 -- Should Fix (Medium)

- **M-1:** Add regex complexity check for SearchFilesTool and EmbeddedSourceManager -- reject patterns with nested quantifiers.
- **M-5:** Document DNS rebinding limitation in WebFetchTool SSRF protection.
- **M-4:** Gate `testToolExecution()` behind `debugMode` check in production builds.
- **M-6:** Provide enterprise-mode local-only provider restriction.
- **M-7:** Provide mode config to disable `manage_source` for enterprise.
- ~~**M-9:** Add CSP meta tag to sandbox srcdoc HTML.~~ **RESOLVED 2026-03-01** — CSP added: `default-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'`.
- **M-11:** Document CDN runtime loading in enterprise security documentation. **Note (2026-03-01):** CDN loading now uses esm.sh `?bundle` with recursive dependency resolution (incl. Node polyfills). `requestUrl` (Obsidian API) is used, not `fetch`.

### P3 -- Consider Fixing (Low + Info)

- **L-1:** GlobalFileService path join -- add `..` check as defense-in-depth.
- **L-3:** Custom recipes -- consider disabling for enterprise profiles.
- **L-4:** MCP mutual TLS -- document as limitation for enterprise.
- **L-5:** Package integrity checks for `ensurePackage()`.
- **I-1:** `dangerouslyAllowBrowser` -- no action needed.
- ~~**I-2:** Add CSP to sandbox iframe -- defense-in-depth.~~ **RESOLVED 2026-03-01.**
